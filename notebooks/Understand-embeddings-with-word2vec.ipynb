The magic comes from the way Word2Vec is trained. The details are quite complex, but you can remember that Word2vec, in `word2vec = Word2Vec(sentences=X_train)`, actually trains a internal neural network (that you don't see).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, this internal neural network predicts a word from the surroundings words in a sentences. Hence, it splits the original sentences, then for each split it chooses some words as inputs $X$ and a word as the output $y$ which it tries to predict, using the embedding space.\n",
