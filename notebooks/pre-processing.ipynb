       "'\"  In the midst of a sandy desert somewhere in Asia the eyes of travellers are refreshed by the sight of a high mountain covered with beautiful trees among which the glitter of foaming waterfalls may be seen in the sunlight. In that clear still air it is even possible to hear the song of the birds and smell of the flowers; but though the mountain is plainly inhabited--for here and there a white tent is visible--none of the kings or princes who pass it on the road to Babylon or Baalbec ever plunge into its forests--or if they do they never come back. Indeed so great is the terror caused by the evil reputation of the mountain that fathers on their death-beds pray their sons never to try to fathom its mysteries. But in spite of its ill-fame a certain number of young men every year announce their intention of visiting it and as we have said are never seen again.  * * * * *  Now there was once a powerful king who ruled over a country on the other side of the desert and when dying gave the usual counsel to his seven sons. Hardly however was he dead than the eldest who succeeded to the throne announced his intention of hunting in the enchanted mountain. In vain the old men shook their heads and tried to persuade him to give up his mad scheme. All was useless; he went but did not return; and in due time the throne was filled by his next brother.  And so it happened to the other five but when the youngest became king and he also proclaimed a hunt in the mountain a loud lament was raised in the city.  \\'Who will reign over us when you are dead? For dead you surely will be\\' cried they. \\'Stay with us and we will make you happy.\\' And for a while he listened to their prayers and the land grew rich and prosperous under his rule. But in a few years the restless fit again took possession of him and this time he would hear nothing. Hunt in that forest he would and calling his friends and attendants round him he set out one morning across the desert.  They were riding through a rocky valley when a deer sprang up in front of them and bounded away. The king instantly gave chase followed by his attendants; but the animal ran so swiftly that they never could get up to it and at length it vanished in the depths of the forest.  Then the young man drew rein for the first time and looked about him. He had left his companions far behind and glancing back he beheld them entering some tents dotted here and there amongst the trees. For himself the fresh coolness of the woods was more attractive to him than any food however delicious and for hours he strolled about as his fancy led him.  By-and-by however it began to grow dark and he thought that the moment had arrived for them to start for the palace. So leaving the forest with a sigh he made his way down to the tents but what was his horror to find his men lying about some dead some dying. These were past speech but speech was needless. It was as clear as day that the wine they had drunk contained deadly poison.  \\'I am too late to help you my poor friends\\' he said gazing at them sadly; \\'but at least I can avenge you! Those that have set the snare will certainly return to see to its working. I will hide myself somewhere and discover who they are!\\'  Near the spot where he stood he noticed a large walnut tree and into this he climbed. Night soon fell and nothing broke the stillness of the place; but with the earliest glimpse of dawn a noise of galloping hoofs was heard.  Pushing the branches aside the young man beheld a youth approaching mounted on a white horse. On reaching the tents the cavalier dismounted and closely inspected the dead bodies that lay about them. Then one by one he dragged them to a ravine close by and threw them into a lake at the bottom. While he was doing this the servants who had followed him led away the horses of the ill-fated men and the courtiers were ordered to let loose the deer which was used as a decoy and to see that the tables in the tents were covered as before with food and wine.  Having made these arrangements he strolled slowly through the forest but great was his surprise to come upon a beautiful horse hidden in the depths of a thicket.  \\'There was a horse for every dead man\\' he said to himself. \\'Then whose is this?\\'  \\'Mine!\\' answered a voice from a walnut tree close by. \\'Who are you that lure men into your power and then poison them? But you shall do so no longer. Return to your house wherever it may be and we will fight before it!\\'  The cavalier remained speechless with anger at these words; then with a great effort he replied:  \\'I accept your challenge. Mount and follow me. I am Zoulvisia.\\' And springing on his horse he was out of sight so quickly that the king had only time to notice that light seemed to flow from himself and his steed and that the hair under his helmet was like liquid gold.  Clearly the cavalier was a woman. But who could she be? Was she queen of all the queens? Or was she chief of a band of robbers? She was neither: only a beautiful maiden. [Illustration: I '"
