As Emperor I am overwhelmed with\\n\\ntroubles, while here in this convent, which is a little kingdom in\\n\\nitself, one would have nothing to worry about. I cannot believe it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nImmediately on setting foot in the village inn, the Emperor sent the\\n\\nhostess to fetch the Abbot of this singular convent.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can imagine what a state of mind the latter was in when he heard he\\n\\nwas summoned to the Emperor\\'s presence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What have I done to displease him?\" he asked himself. On the way he\\n\\nexamined his conscience over and over again, and he could think of no\\n\\nfault of which he was guilty. \"I am in troubled waters; I must steer my\\n\\nway through,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he was in the Emperor\\'s presence, the latter expressed his\\n\\nastonishment of what he had read.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Abbot now knew why he had been summoned, and smiled. \"Sir,\" said he,\\n\\n\"does that astonish you? However, it is very simple; we eat, we drink,\\n\\nwe sleep, and worry over nothing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Reverend Abbot, that state of things must come to an end,\" said\\n\\nthe Emperor, \"and in order that you may have your share of trouble, I\\n\\ncommand you to bring me to-morrow the answers to the three following\\n\\nquestions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"First, What is the depth of the sea?\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Secondly, How many cows\\' tails would it take to measure the distance\\n\\nbetween the earth and the sun?\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thirdly, What am I thinking about?\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Try to please me or I shall exact a penalty from you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nOn hearing these words, the Abbot returned to his convent with a heavy\\n\\nheart. From that moment he knew no peace. He cudgeled his brains as to\\n\\nwhat answer he could make to the Emperor.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the little bell of the abbey rang, summoning the monks to prayer in\\n\\nthe chapel, the Abbot continued to pace his garden. He was so deep in\\n\\nthought that he was quite oblivious of what was taking place around him.\\n\\nEven if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet, he would not have noticed\\n\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What a horrible thing,\" he thought. \"Is it possible that such a\\n\\nmisfortune has overtaken me? I cannot possibly answer. Who can save the\\n\\nsituation? Perhaps our shepherd could; he has a very lively imagination;\\n\\nbut talk of the devil--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAt that identical moment the shepherd appeared, leading his flock. He\\n\\nwas very surprised to see the Abbot, who was always without a care,\\n\\nmediating in solitude.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat could have happened?\\n\\n\\n\\nWithout more ado he went to him, and asked him what was troubling him so\\n\\ndeeply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I deserve to be pitied,\" said the Abbot, and he told him what had\\n\\nhappened.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why are you tormenting yourself over a little thing like that?\" the\\n\\nshepherd laughingly replied. \"Leave it to me, and all will be well.\\n\\nTo-morrow I will come here and dress myself in your robe, and I will\\n\\nturn the tables on him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAt first the Abbot demurred, but in the end he yielded, and the matter\\n\\nwas settled.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next day the shepherd went boldly to find the Emperor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Reverend Abbot,\" the Emperor said with serenity, \"have you found\\n\\nout the answers?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, certainly, sire.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Speak, I am listening.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sire, the sea is as deep as a stone\\'s throw.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"To measure the distance between the earth and the sun, you only need\\n\\none cow\\'s tail, if it is long enough.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you wish to know, sire, what you are thinking? Well, at this moment,\\n\\nyou think, sire, that the Abbot of the convent is in your presence, and\\n\\nit is only his shepherd.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Emperor laughed so heartily that if he has not stopped laughing he\\n\\nis laughing still.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: \"WHAT THE GOOD-MAN DOES IS SURE TO BE RIGHT!\"]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 1: In _Christmas Tales of Flanders._ Illustrated and collected\\n\\nby Jean De Bosschere. Dodd, Mead & Company.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"WHAT THE GOOD-MAN DOES IS SURE TO BE RIGHT!\"[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI AM going to tell you a story that was told to me when I was a little\\n\\none, and which I like better and better the oftener I think of it. For\\n\\nit is with stories as with some men and women, the older they grow, the\\n\\npleasanter they grow, and that is delightful!\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course you have been into the country? Well, then, you must have seen\\n\\na regularly poor old cottage. Moss and weeds spring up amid the thatch\\n\\nof the roof, a stork\\'s nest decorates the chimney (the stork can never\\n\\nbe dispensed with), the walls are aslant, the windows low (in fact, only\\n\\none of them can be shut), the baking-oven projects forward, and an\\n\\nelder-bush leans over the gate, where you will see a tiny pond with a\\n\\nduck and ducklings in it, close under a knotted old willow-tree. Yes,\\n\\nand then there is a watch-dog that barks at every passer-by.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust such a poor little cottage as this was the one in my story, and in\\n\\nit dwelt a husband and wife. Few as their possessions were, one of them\\n\\nthey could do without, and that was a horse, that used to graze in the\\n\\nditch beside the highroad. The good-man rode on it to town, he lent it\\n\\nto his neighbors, and received slight services from them in return, but\\n\\nstill it would be more profitable to sell the horse, or else exchange it\\n\\nfor something they could make of more frequent use. But which should\\n\\nthey do? sell, or exchange?\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, you will find out what is best, good-man,\" said the wife. \"Isn\\'t\\n\\nthis market-day? Come, ride off to the town--get money, or what you can\\n\\nfor the horse--whatever you do is sure to be right. Make haste for the\\n\\nmarket!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo she tied on his neckerchief--for that was a matter she understood\\n\\nbetter than he--she tied it with a double knot, and made him look quite\\n\\nspruce; she dusted his hat with the palm of her hand; and she kissed him\\n\\nand sent him off, riding the horse that was to be either sold or\\n\\nbartered. Of course, he would know what to do.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sun was hot, and not a cloud in the sky. The road was dusty, and\\n\\nsuch a crowd of folk passed on their way to market. Some in wagons, some\\n\\non horseback, some on their own legs. A fierce sun and no shade all the\\n\\nway.\\n\\n\\n\\nA man came driving a cow--as pretty a cow as could be. \"That creature\\n\\nmust give beautiful milk,\" thought the peasant; \"it would not be a bad\\n\\nbargain if I got that. I say, you fellow with the cow!\" he began aloud:\\n\\n\"let\\'s have some talk together. Look you, a horse, I believe, costs more\\n\\nthan a cow, but it is all the same to me, as I have more use for a\\n\\ncow--shall we make an exchange?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"To be sure!\" was the answer, and the bargain was made.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe good-man might just as well now turn back homeward--he had finished\\n\\nhis business. But he had made up his mind to go to market, so to market\\n\\nhe must go, if only to look on, so, with his cow, he continued on his\\n\\nway. He trudged fast, so did the cow, and soon they overtook a man who\\n\\nwas leading a sheep--a sheep in good condition, well clothed with wool.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I should very much like to have that!\" said the peasant. \"It would find\\n\\npasture enough by our road-side, and in winter we might take it into our\\n\\nown room. And really it would be more reasonable for us to be keeping a\\n\\nsheep than a cow. Shall we exchange?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, the man who owned the sheep was quite willing; so the exchange was\\n\\nmade, and the good-man now went on with his sheep. Presently there\\n\\npassed him a man with a big goose under his arm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, you have got a heavy fellow there!\" quoth the peasant. \"Feathers\\n\\nand fat in plenty! How nicely we could tie her up near our little pond,\\n\\nand it would be something for the good-wife to gather up the scraps for.\\n\\nShe has often said: \\'If we had but a goose!\\' Now she can have one--and\\n\\nshe shall, too! Will you exchange? I will give you my sheep for your\\n\\ngoose, and say \\'thank you\\' besides.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe other had no objection, so the peasant had his will and his goose.\\n\\nHe was now close to the town; he was wearied with the heat and the\\n\\ncrowd, folk and cattle pushing past him, thronging on the road, in the\\n\\nditch, and close up to the turnpike-man\\'s cabbage-garden, where his one\\n\\nhen was tied up, lest in her fright she should lose her way and be\\n\\ncarried off. It was a short-backed hen: she winked with one eye, crying,\\n\\n\"Cluck, cluck!\" What she was thinking of I can\\'t say, but what the\\n\\npeasant thought on seeing her, was this: \"That is the prettiest hen I\\n\\nhave ever seen--much prettier than any of our parson\\'s chickens. I\\n\\nshould very much like to have her. A hen can always pick up a grain here\\n\\nand there--can provide for herself. I almost think it would be a good\\n\\nplan to take her instead of the goose. Shall we exchange?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Exchange?\" repeated the owner; \"not a bad idea!\" So it was done; the\\n\\nturnpike-man got the goose, the peasant the hen.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had transacted a deal of business since first starting on his way to\\n\\nthe town; hot was he, and wearied too; he must have a dram and a bit of\\n\\nbread. He was on the point of entering an inn, when the innkeeper met\\n\\nhim in the doorway swinging a sack chock-full of something.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What have you there?\" asked the peasant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mellow apples,\" was the answer, \"a whole sackful for swine.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What a quantity! wouldn\\'t my wife like to see so many! Why, the last\\n\\nyear we had only one single apple on the whole tree at home. Ah! I wish\\n\\nmy wife could see them!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, what will you give me for them?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Give for them? why, I will give you my hen.\" So he gave the hen, took\\n\\nthe apples, and entered the inn, and going straight up to the bar, set\\n\\nhis sack upright against the stove without considering that there was a\\n\\nfire lighted inside. A good many strangers were present, among them two\\n\\nEnglishmen, both with their pockets full of gold, and fond of laying\\n\\nwagers, as Englishmen in stories are wont to be.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently there came a sound from the stove, \"Suss--suss--suss!\" the\\n\\napples were roasting. \"What is that?\" folk asked, and soon heard the\\n\\nwhole history of the horse that had been exchanged, first for a cow, and\\n\\nlastly for a sack of rotten apples.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well! won\\'t you get a good sound cuff from your wife, when you go\\n\\nhome?\" said one of the Englishmen. \"Something heavy enough to fell an\\n\\nox, I warn you!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I shall get kisses, not cuffs,\" replied the peasant. \"My wife will say,\\n\\n\\'Whatever the good-man does is right.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"A wager!\" cried the Englishmen, \"for a hundred pounds?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Say rather a bushelful,\" quoth the peasant, \"and I can only lay my\\n\\nbushel of apples with myself and the good-wife, but that will be more\\n\\nthan full measure, I trow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Done!\" cried they. And the innkeeper\\'s cart was brought out forthwith,\\n\\nthe Englishmen got into it, the peasant got into it, the rotten apples\\n\\ngot into it, and away they sped to the peasant\\'s cottage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Good evening, wife.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Same to you, good-man.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I have exchanged the horse, not sold it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said the wife, taking his hand, and in her eagerness to\\n\\nlisten noticing neither the sack nor the strangers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I exchanged the horse for a cow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"O! how delightful! now we can have milk, butter, and cheese, on our\\n\\ntable. What a capital idea!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, but I exchanged the cow for a sheep.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Better and better!\" cried the wife. \"You are always so thoughtful; we\\n\\nhave only just grass enough for a sheep. But now we shall have ewe\\'s\\n\\nmilk, and ewe\\'s cheese, and woolen stockings, nay, woolen jackets too;\\n\\nand a cow would not give us that; she loses all her hairs. But you are\\n\\nalways such a clever fellow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But the ewe I exchanged again for a goose.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What! shall we really keep Michaelmas this year, good-man? You are\\n\\nalways thinking of what will please me, and that was a beautiful\\n\\nthought. The goose can be tethered to the willow-tree and grow fat for\\n\\nMichaelmas Day.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But I gave the goose away for a hen,\" said the peasant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"A hen? well, that was a good exchange,\" said his wife. \"A hen will lay\\n\\neggs, sit upon them, and we shall have chickens. Fancy! a hen-yard! that\\n\\nis just the thing I have always wished for most.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, but I exchanged the hen for a sack of mellow apples.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then I must give thee a kiss,\" cried the wife. \"Thanks, my own husband.\\n\\nAnd now I have something to tell. When you were gone I thought how I\\n\\ncould get a right good dinner ready for you: omelets with parsley. Now I\\n\\nhad the eggs, but not the parsley. So I went over to the schoolmaster\\'s;\\n\\nthey have parsley, I know, but the woman is so crabbed, she wanted\\n\\nsomething for it. Now what could I give her? nothing grows in our\\n\\ngarden, not even a rotten apple, not even that had I for her; but now I\\n\\ncan give her ten, nay, a whole sackful. That is famous, good-man!\" and\\n\\nshe kissed him again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well done!\" cried the Englishmen. \"Always down hill, and always happy!\\n\\nSuch a sight is worth the money!\" And so quite contentedly they paid the\\n\\nbushelful of gold pieces to the peasant, who had got kisses, not cuffs,\\n\\nby his bargains.\\n\\n\\n\\nCertainly virtue is her own reward, when the wife is sure that her\\n\\nhusband is the wisest man in the world, and that whatever he does is\\n\\nright. So now you have heard this old story that was once told to me,\\n\\nand I hope have learnt the moral.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: WHERE TO LAY THE BLAME]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 2: Reprinted by special permission from _Stories and Tales_,\\n\\nby Hans Christian Andersen.

This is how it was with a man of whom\\n\\n     I shall tell you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHERE was once upon a time a fisherman who had fished all day long and\\n\\nhad caught not so much as a sprat. So at night there he sat by the fire,\\n\\nrubbing his knees and warming his shins, and waiting for supper that his\\n\\nwife was cooking for him, and his hunger was as sharp as vinegar, and\\n\\nhis temper hot enough to fry fat.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile he sat there grumbling and growling and trying to make himself\\n\\ncomfortable and warm, there suddenly came a knock at the door. The good\\n\\nwoman opened it, and there stood an old man, clad all in red from head\\n\\nto foot, and with a snowy beard at his chin as white as winter snow.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fisherman\\'s wife stood gasping and staring at the strange figure,\\n\\nbut the old man in red walked straight into the hut. \"Bring your nets,\\n\\nfisherman,\" said he, \"and come with me. There is something that I want\\n\\nyou to catch for me, and if I have luck I will pay you for your fishing\\n\\nas never fisherman was paid before.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not I,\" said the fisherman; \"I go out no more this night. I have been\\n\\nfishing all day long until my back is nearly broken, and have caught\\n\\nnothing, and now I am not such a fool as to go out and leave a good\\n\\nsupper and a warm fire at your bidding.\" But the fisherman\\'s wife had\\n\\nlistened to what the old man had said about paying for the job, and she\\n\\nwas of a different mind from her husband. \"Come,\" said she, \"the old man\\n\\npromises to pay you well. This is not a chance to be lost, I can tell\\n\\nyou, and my advice to you is that you go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fisherman shook his head. No, he would not go; he had said he would\\n\\nnot, and he would not. But the wife only smiled and said again, \"My\\n\\nadvice to you is that you go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fisherman grumbled and grumbled, and swore that he would not go. The\\n\\nwife said nothing but one thing. She did not argue; she did not lose her\\n\\ntemper; she only said to everything that he said, \"My advice to you is\\n\\nthat you go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last the fisherman\\'s anger boiled over. \"Very well,\" said he,\\n\\nspitting his words at her; \"if you drive me out into the night, I\\n\\nsuppose I will have to go.\" And then he spoke the words that so many men\\n\\nsay: \"Many a man has come to trouble by following his wife\\'s advice.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen down he took his fur cap and up he took his nets, and off he and\\n\\nthe old man marched through the moonlight, their shadows bobbing along\\n\\nlike black spiders behind them.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, on they went, out from the town and across the fields and through\\n\\nthe woods, until at last they came to a dreary, lonesome desert, where\\n\\nnothing was to be seen but gray rocks and weeds and thistles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the fisherman, \"I have fished, man and boy, for forty-seven\\n\\nyears, but never did I see as unlikely a place to catch anything as\\n\\nthis.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the old man said never a word. First of all he drew a great circle\\n\\nwith strange figures, marking it with his finger upon the ground. Then\\n\\nout from under his red gown he brought a tinder-box and steel, and a\\n\\nlittle silver casket covered all over with strange figures of serpents\\n\\nand dragons and what not. He brought some sticks of spice-wood from his\\n\\npouch, and then he struck a light and made a fire. Out of the box he\\n\\ntook a gray powder, which he flung upon the little blaze.\\n\\n\\n\\nPuff! flash! A vivid flame went up into the moonlight, and then a dense\\n\\nsmoke as black as ink, which spread out wider and wider, far and near,\\n\\ntill all below was darker than the darkest midnight. Then the old man\\n\\nbegan to utter strange spells and words.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently there began a rumbling that sounded louder and louder and\\n\\nnearer and nearer, until it roared and bellowed like thunder. The earth\\n\\nrocked and swayed, and the poor fisherman shook and trembled with fear\\n\\ntill his teeth chattered in his head.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen suddenly the roaring and bellowing ceased, and all was as still as\\n\\ndeath, though the darkness was as thick and black as ever. \"Now,\" said\\n\\nthe old magician--for such he was--\"now we are about to take a journey\\n\\nsuch as no one ever traveled before. Heed well what I tell you. Speak\\n\\nnot a single word, for if you do, misfortune will be sure to happen.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ain\\'t I to say anything?\" said the fisherman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not even \\'boo\\' to a goose?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, that is pretty hard upon a man who likes to say his say,\" said\\n\\nthe fisherman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And moreover,\" said the old man, \"I must blindfold you as well.\"\\n\\nThereupon he took from his pocket a handkerchief, and made ready to tie\\n\\nit about the fisherman\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And ain\\'t I to see anything at all?\" said the fisherman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not even so much as a single feather?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, then,\" said the fisherman, \"I wish I\\'d not come.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the old man tied the handkerchief tightly around his eyes, and then\\n\\nhe was as blind as a bat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now,\" said the old man, \"throw your leg over what you feel and hold\\n\\nfast.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fisherman reached down his hand, and there felt the back of\\n\\nsomething rough and hairy. He flung his leg over it, and whisk! whizz!\\n\\noff he shot through the air like a sky-rocket. Nothing was left for him\\n\\nto do but grip tightly with hands and feet and to hold fast. On they\\n\\nwent, and on they went, until, after a great while, whatever it was that\\n\\nwas carrying him lit upon the ground, and there the fisherman found\\n\\nhimself standing, for that which had brought him had gone.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe old man whipped the handkerchief off his eyes, and there the\\n\\nfisherman found himself on the shores of the sea, where there was\\n\\nnothing to be seen but water upon one side and rocks and naked sand\\n\\nupon the other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This is the place for you to cast your nets,\" said the old magician;\\n\\n\"for if we catch nothing here we catch nothing at all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fisherman unrolled his nets and cast them and dragged them, and then\\n\\ncast them and dragged them again, but neither time caught so much as a\\n\\nherring. But the third time that he cast he found that he had caught\\n\\nsomething that weighed as heavy as lead. He pulled and pulled, until\\n\\nby-and-by he dragged the load ashore, and what should it be but a great\\n\\nchest of wood, blackened by sea-water, and covered with shells and green\\n\\nmoss.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat was the very thing that the magician had come to fish for. From his\\n\\npouch the old man took a little golden key, which he fitted into a\\n\\nkey-hole in the side of the chest. He threw back the lid; the fisherman\\n\\nlooked within, and there was the prettiest little palace that man\\'s eye\\n\\never beheld, all made of mother-of-pearl and silver-frosted as white as\\n\\nsnow. The old magician lifted the little palace out of the box and set\\n\\nit upon the ground.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, lo and behold! a marvelous thing happened; for the palace\\n\\ninstantly began to grow for all the world like a soap-bubble, until it\\n\\nstood in the moonlight gleaming and glistening like snow, the windows\\n\\nbright with the lights of a thousand wax tapers, and the sound of music\\n\\nand voices and laughter coming from within.\\n\\n\\n\\nHardly could the fisherman catch his breath from one strange thing when\\n\\nanother happened. The old magician took off his clothes and his\\n\\nface--yes, his face--for all the world as though it had been a mask, and\\n\\nthere stood as handsome and noble a young man as ever the light looked\\n\\non. Then, beckoning to the fisherman, dumb with wonder, he led the way\\n\\nup the great flight of marble steps to the palace door. As he came the\\n\\ndoor swung open with a blaze of light, and there stood hundreds of\\n\\nnoblemen, all clad in silks and satins and velvets, who, when they saw\\n\\nthe magician, bowed low before him, as though he had been a king.\\n\\nLeading the way, they brought the two through halls and chambers and\\n\\nroom after room, each more magnificent than the other, until they came\\n\\nto one that surpassed a hundredfold any of the others.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the farther end was a golden throne, and upon it sat a lady more\\n\\nlovely and beautiful than a dream, her eyes as bright as diamonds, her\\n\\ncheeks like rose leaves, and her hair like spun gold. She came half-way\\n\\ndown the steps of the throne to welcome the magician, and when the two\\n\\nmet they kissed one another before all those who were looking on. Then\\n\\nshe brought him to the throne and seated him beside her, and there they\\n\\ntalked for a long time very earnestly.\\n\\n\\n\\nNobody said a word to the fisherman, who stood staring about him like an\\n\\nowl. \"I wonder,\" said he to himself at last, \"if they will give a body a\\n\\nbite to eat by-and-by?\" for, to tell the truth, the good supper he had\\n\\ncome away from at home had left a sharp hunger gnawing at his insides,\\n\\nand he longed for something good and warm to fill the empty place. But\\n\\ntime passed, and not so much as a crust of bread was brought to stay his\\n\\nstomach.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy-and-by the clock struck twelve, and then the two who sat upon the\\n\\nthrone arose. The beautiful lady took the magician by the hand, and,\\n\\nturning to those who stood around, said, in a loud voice, \"Behold him\\n\\nwho alone is worthy to possess the jewel of jewels! Unto him do I give\\n\\nit, and with it all power of powers!\" Thereon she opened a golden casket\\n\\nthat stood beside her, and brought thence a little crystal ball, about\\n\\nas big as a pigeon\\'s egg, in which was something that glistened like a\\n\\nspark of fire. The magician took the crystal ball and thrust it into his\\n\\nbosom; but what it was the fisherman could not guess, and if you do not\\n\\nknow I shall not tell you.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen for the first time the beautiful lady seemed to notice the\\n\\nfisherman. She beckoned him, and when he stood beside her two men came\\n\\ncarrying a chest. The chief treasurer opened it, and it was full of bags\\n\\nof gold money. \"How will you have it?\" said the beautiful lady.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Have what?\" said the fisherman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Have the pay for your labor?\" said the beautiful lady.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I will,\" said the fisherman, promptly, \"take it in my hat.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So be it,\" said the beautiful lady. She waved her hand, and the chief\\n\\ntreasurer took a bag from the chest, untied it, and emptied a cataract\\n\\nof gold into the fur cap. The fisherman had never seen so much wealth in\\n\\nall his life before, and he stood like a man turned to stone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is all this mine?\" said the fisherman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is,\" said the beautiful lady.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then God bless your pretty eyes,\" said the fisherman.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the magician kissed the beautiful lady, and, beckoning to the\\n\\nfisherman, left the throne room the same way that they had come. The\\n\\nnoblemen, in silks and satins and velvets, marched ahead, and back they\\n\\nwent through the other apartments, until at last they came to the door.\\n\\nOut they stepped, and then what do you suppose happened!\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the wonderful palace had grown like a bubble, like a bubble it\\n\\nvanished. There the two stood on the sea-shore, with nothing to be seen\\n\\nbut rocks and sand and water, and the starry sky overhead. The fisherman\\n\\nshook his cap of gold, and it jingled and tinkled, and was as heavy as\\n\\nlead. If it was not all a dream, he was rich for life. \"But anyhow,\"\\n\\nsaid he, \"they might have given a body a bite to eat.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe magician put on his red clothes and his face again, making himself\\n\\nas hoary and as old as before. He took out flint and steel, and his\\n\\nsticks of spice-wood and his gray powder, and made a great fire and\\n\\nsmoke just as he had done before. Then again he tied his handkerchief\\n\\nover the fisherman\\'s eyes. \"Remember,\" said he, \"what I told you when we\\n\\nstarted upon our journey. Keep your mouth tight shut, for if you utter\\n\\nso much as a single word you are a lost man. Now throw your leg over\\n\\nwhat you feel and hold fast.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fisherman had his net over one arm and his cap of gold in the other\\n\\nhand; nevertheless, there he felt the same hairy thing he had felt\\n\\nbefore. He flung his leg over it, and away he was gone through the air\\n\\nlike a sky-rocket.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, he had grown somewhat used to strange things by this time, so he\\n\\nbegan to think he would like to see what sort of a creature it was upon\\n\\nwhich he was riding thus through the sky. So he contrived, in spite of\\n\\nhis net and cap, to push up the handkerchief from over one eye. Out he\\n\\npeeped, and then he saw what the strange steed was. He was riding upon a\\n\\nhe-goat as black as night, and in front of him was the magician riding\\n\\nupon just such another, his great red robe fluttering out in the\\n\\nmoonlight like huge red wings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Great herring and little fishes!\" roared the fisherman; \"it is a\\n\\nbilly-goat!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nInstantly goats, old man, and all were gone like a flash. Down fell the\\n\\nfisherman through the empty sky, whirling over and over and around and\\n\\naround like a frog. He held tightly to his net, but away flew his fur\\n\\ncap, the golden money falling in a shower like sparks of yellow light.\\n\\nDown he fell and down he fell, until his head spun like a top.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy good-luck his house was just below, with its thatch of soft rushes.\\n\\nInto the very middle of it he tumbled, and right through the\\n\\nthatch--bump!--into the room below.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe good wife was in bed, snoring away for dear life; but such a noise\\n\\nas the fisherman made coming into the house was enough to wake the dead.\\n\\nUp she jumped, and there she sat, staring and winking with sleep, and\\n\\nwith her brains as addled as a duck\\'s egg in a thunderstorm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There!\" said the fisherman, as he gathered himself up and rubbed his\\n\\nshoulder, \"that is what comes of following a woman\\'s advice!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: THE WINDS, THE BIRDS, AND THE TELEGRAPH WIRES]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 3: Reprinted by special permission from _Twilight Land,_ by\\n\\nHoward Pyle. Copyright by Harper & Brothers]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE WINDS, THE BIRDS, AND THE TELEGRAPH WIRES[4]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLONG, long ago, a hundred times as long as any one can remember, the\\n\\nGreat Earth King became so very, very busy about a great many things\\n\\nthat there were several things that he could not do. So he sat himself\\n\\ndown and rested his great head upon his hand, and thought, and thought,\\n\\nand thought until he decided that he must have some assistance. He would\\n\\nadvertise for some messengers! So he seized a great brush, as big as a\\n\\nchurch steeple, dipped it into the red and golden sunset light, and\\n\\nwrote in big letters high on the sky, that every one far and near could\\n\\nread:\\n\\n\\n\\n     WANTED! MESSENGERS! FLEETER THAN HORSES, SWIFTER THAN MEN, TO CARRY\\n\\n     MY MESSAGES, A MILLION TIMES TEN.\\n\\n\\n\\nand he signed it simply, \"The Earth King.\" Then he went into his rainbow\\n\\nhouse and laid himself down to sleep on his rainbow bed.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had scarcely fallen asleep when there came a _rustle, rustle,\\n\\nrustle_ at the rainbow window,\\n\\nand a _rattle, rattle, rattle_ at the rainbow door. He sprang quickly\\n\\nfrom his great bed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who be ye?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We be messengers,\" came the reply, \"come to serve the King.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the King opened the door. There before him stood four of the\\n\\nstrangest creatures that he had ever seen. They were so light that they\\n\\ncould stand on nothing; they had great wide wings; they had pale faces\\n\\nand gleaming eyes; and they had light garments that floated and flapped\\n\\nand fluttered in the breeze.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What are your names?\" asked the King.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We are the Winds,\" answered the mightiest of the four, \"East Wind, West\\n\\nWind, South Wind, North Wind,\" pointing to each in turn, himself last.\\n\\n\"We have come--\\n\\n\\n\\n    _Fleeter than horses, swifter than men,\\n\\n    To carry your messages, a million times ten._\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the King spoke to them in deep and solemn tone: \"The task is a\\n\\ngreat one. The King\\'s business is grave and important. My messengers\\n\\nmust be swift and faithful. Are ye able?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the four winds piously crossed their breasts with their wings and\\n\\nwhispered, \"Try us and see, try us and see, try us and see.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the King tried them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Down by the sea,\" said the King, \"far over the mountains, many hours\\n\\naway, there lives a fisher folk that I love. Every day the men of the\\n\\nvillage go forth in their little boats to fish, and every evening they\\n\\ncome home with their catch. But of late thick and heavy clouds have hung\\n\\nabout them. They have not dared go forth lest they should not reach home\\n\\nagain, and their families begin to be in want. Go to them to-day. Drive\\n\\naway the fog and clouds that the people may be happy again. Quick!\\n\\naway!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the four winds lifted their swift, beautiful wings and were gone.\\n\\nFaster and faster they flew till none could tell how fast they flew.\\n\\nOver the meadows they went and over the mountains. Each tried to\\n\\noutwing the others until it became a fierce and careless game. So\\n\\nblind and careless were they in their sport that they did not notice how\\n\\nthey whirled the sand, and broke the trees, and tossed the water.\\n\\nSwiftly through the fishing village they tore, hurling its poor houses\\n\\nto the ground and _crashing, dashing, slashing, smashing_ the waves\\n\\nupon the fallen wrecks and the frightened and suffering folk.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot until they were weary with their furious sport did they remember the\\n\\nerrand on which the King had sent them. They retraced their steps as\\n\\nquickly as they could, but alas! to their shame and grief, the village\\n\\nlay in ruins and the people wept for their loss.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the Earth King was very sad and angry. He brought the shameful\\n\\nwinds before his court. \"False and faithless winds,\" he said, in stern\\n\\nand awful voice, \"ye did not do my errand; ye were traitors to your\\n\\ntrust; great shall be your punishment. Nevermore shall ye be my\\n\\nmessengers, evermore shall ye be my slaves. Away from my sight!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the faithless winds departed from before the face of the King, and\\n\\nin shame and sorrow went moaning among the caves and the rocks by the\\n\\nseaside, and sighing among the lonely pine trees in the wilderness, and\\n\\neven to this day you may hear the echoes of their moans and sighs.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Earth King was sorrowful, but not discouraged. Again he seized the\\n\\ngreat paint brush, as big as a church steeple, dipped it into the red\\n\\nand golden sunset light, and wrote in big letters high on the sky that\\n\\nevery one far and near could read:\\n\\n\\n\\n    WANTED! MESSENGERS!\\n\\n    FLEETER THAN HORSES,\\n\\n    SWIFTER THAN MEN,\\n\\n    TO CARRY MY MESSAGES,\\n\\n    A MILLION TIMES TEN.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he went into his rainbow house and laid himself down on his rainbow\\n\\nbed. He scarcely had taken forty winks when he heard a _rat-tat-tatting_\\n\\non the rainbow window and a _rap-rap-rapping_ on the rainbow door.\\n\\nQuickly he leaped from his great bed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who be ye?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We be messengers,\" came a gentle voice through the keyhole, \"come to\\n\\nserve the King.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he opened the door, and there before him flitted and twittered a\\n\\ncompany of the most curious little people that he ever had set eyes\\n\\nupon. They had each a pair of beady eyes, a little pointed nose, a set\\n\\nof little scratchy toes, and the softest kind of a coat, fitting as snug\\n\\nas ever the tailor could make it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What are your names?\" asked the King.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We are the birds, and our names are many. We saw the King\\'s sign in the\\n\\nsky and have come--\\n\\n\\n\\n    _Fleeter than horses, swifter than men,\\n\\n    To carry your messages, a million times ten.\"_\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the King, remembering the Winds, addressed them in very deep and\\n\\nsolemn tones: \"The task is a great one. The King\\'s business is exceeding\\n\\ngrave and important. My messengers must be swift and faithful, must\\n\\nremember my commands and keep my secrets. Are ye able?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nEach bird laid his little scratchy toes on his little pointed nose and\\n\\nvowed that he would remember the King\\'s commands and keep the King\\'s\\n\\nsecrets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then,\" said the King, \"make ready. Far to the north dwells a people\\n\\nthat I love. For many a month they have lived amid ice and snow and the\\n\\nbitter frosts. Now they sigh for warmer days, and I have heard them. I\\n\\nam planning a delightful surprise for them. I am going to carry spring\\n\\nto them. Go, find the warm sunshine and the soft south wind and bid them\\n\\ncome at once to the King\\'s court, that I may take them and the spring\\n\\ndays to my suffering and discouraged people. Then return with all speed\\n\\nto the King, and remember --do not betray my secret.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bird-messengers hastened away as fast as ever their wings could\\n\\ncarry them. They summoned the warm sunshine and the soft south wind and\\n\\nbade them make haste to the Earth King. They, of course, turned back as\\n\\nthey were commanded, but before they reached home again, each one of\\n\\nthem was seized with a strange, restless, uneasy feeling right in the\\n\\nmiddle of his feathers. It must have been the secret trying to get out.\\n\\nOne by one they stole past the King\\'s house under cover of the night and\\n\\nmade their way to the north country. And when the morning came, there\\n\\nthey were, sitting on the fence posts and in the apple trees, just\\n\\nbursting with the happy secret of the King.\\n\\n\\n\\n    _Then the robin pipped, and the bluebird blew;\\n\\n    The sparrow chipped, and the swallow, too:\\n\\n    \"We know something,--we won\\'t tell,--\\n\\n    Somebody\\'s coming,--you know well.\\n\\n    This is his name (\\'twixt you and me),\\n\\n          S-P-R-I-N-G.\"_\\n\\n\\n\\nThe people were very happy when they heard what the birds said, and with\\n\\nmuch excitement began to get ready for the springtime.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, of course, the King knew nothing about all this, and was very happy\\n\\nin thinking of the surprise that he was to give the people. He took the\\n\\nwarm sunshine and the soft south wind for companions, and made his way\\n\\nin all haste to the land of ice and snow. As he arrived, with his\\n\\ndelightful secret, as he thought, hidden in his heart, he was amazed to\\n\\nfind an old woman sitting in her doorway knitting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why are you sitting here?\" he asked. \"Why are you not within, warming\\n\\nyour feet by the fire?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, don\\'t you know?\" she said, \"spring is coming!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Spring?\" he asked, almost roughly; \"how do you know?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said she with a smile, trying not to look at a robin that turned\\n\\nhis back behind the picket fence, hoping that if the King saw him he\\n\\nmight think he was an English sparrow, \"a little bird told me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe King walked up the street, looking gloomy enough, and soon came\\n\\nacross a gardener with his rake, uncovering the crocuses and the\\n\\ndaffodils.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why do you do this, my good man? Surely your flowers will freeze. You\\n\\nhad much better be covering them up.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, no,\" he said, straightening his bent back, \"spring is coming.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Spring,\" said the King; \"how do _you_ know?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said the gardener, with a grin, and a twinkle in his left eye, as\\n\\nhe caught sight of a bluebird peeking half-scared around the limb of a\\n\\nnear-by apple tree, \"a little bird told me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the disgraceful story all came out: that\\n\\n\\n\\n    _The robin pipped, and the bluebird blew;\\n\\n    The sparrow chipped, and the swallow, too:\\n\\n    \"We know something,--we won\\'t tell,--\\n\\n    Somebody\\'s coming,--you know well.\\n\\n    This is his name (\\'twixt you and me),\\n\\n          S-P-R-I-N-G.\"_\\n\\n\\n\\nMy! but wasn\\'t the Earth King disgusted! And weren\\'t the bird-messengers\\n\\nashamed to come when he sternly called them! Each laid his little\\n\\npointed nose on his little scratchy toes, and dropped his eyes and\\n\\nuttered never a word.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Silly birds,\" he said in scornful voice. \"You vowed to keep my secrets.\\n\\nYou have broken your vow. You obeyed my commands and called the south\\n\\nwind and the sunshine; so I cannot be too harsh with you. But you cannot\\n\\nkeep my secrets, so I cannot keep you as my messengers. Now and then I\\n\\nmay use you as my servants. Adieu!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the birds flew sadly away as quietly and quickly as ever they\\n\\ncould, and set to work building their nests in holes in the trees and\\n\\nholes in the ground and in out-of-the-way places, making such a\\n\\nchattering meantime that neither they, nor any one else, could hear\\n\\nthemselves think.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy this time the Earth King was nearly discouraged. He did not know what\\n\\nin the world to do. He rested his elbow on his knee and his great head\\n\\nin his hand and thought and wondered. Then once again he rose and took\\n\\nthe great brush and wrote the same big words on the sky. And for very\\n\\nweariness he lay down on a great bank of clouds and soon was sound\\n\\nasleep. As he slept, the cloud grew bigger and bigger and blacker and\\n\\nblacker, and the thunder came nearer and nearer until, all at once,\\n\\nCRASH-CRASH--the cloud seemed torn to pieces and the King leaped to his\\n\\nfeet half-scared to death, even if he was a King. There before him,\\n\\ndarting this way and that way, and up and down, and across-ways, was a\\n\\nswarm of little red-hot creatures that hissed and buzzed and cracked\\n\\nlike the Fourth of July.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who are you?\" he asked in half-fright as he rubbed his eyes, \"and what\\n\\ndo you want?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Messengers, messengers, messengers,\" whispered they all at once, \"and\\n\\nwe have come to serve the King.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What are your names?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We are the Lightning Spirits; sometimes men call us Electricity--\\n\\n\\n\\n    _The swiftest creatures that are known to men,\\n\\n    To carry your messages, a million times ten.\"_\\n\\n\\n\\nThe King charged them gravely and solemnly, as he had done the winds and\\n\\nthe birds before them, that his messengers must be true and faithful and\\n\\nmust keep his secrets. But no matter how great the task nor how heavy\\n\\nthe oaths with which he bound them to be faithful, they were eager, all\\n\\nof them, to serve the King. Only he must build road-ways for them. They\\n\\nhad not wings to fly, and their feet were not accustomed to the highways\\n\\nof the land. They might lose their way. So the King decided to try them.\\n\\nHe called his laborers and ordered them to erect tall poles, and from\\n\\npole to pole to lay slender roadways of wire. Miles and miles of these\\n\\nroadways he built, over the hills and through the valleys. And when all\\n\\nwas complete, he called the spirits to him and whispered to them his\\n\\nsecret messages. Quick as thought they ran over the little roadways,\\n\\nhither and thither, and back again, doing faithfully and well the King\\'s\\n\\nerrands and keeping the King\\'s secrets. They whispered never so much as\\n\\na word of them. So the Earth King called a great assembly, and before\\n\\nthem all appointed the Lightning Spirits to be his trusted messengers\\n\\nfor ever and a day.\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course the winds were very jealous when they heard of it, and they\\n\\ndetermined to get revenge by stealing the messages from the spirits.\\n\\nThey dashed against the wires day after day, trying to break them and\\n\\nget the secrets, but all to no purpose. All they could hear was\\n\\nMUM-MUM-MUM-M-M; and the harder they blew, the louder they heard it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe birds had all along been sorry that they had given away the great\\n\\nsecret, and had been hoping that the King would give them another\\n\\nchance. They were much too gentle to do as the winds did. But they were\\n\\nvery curious to find out what the King\\'s messages were. So day after day\\n\\nthey went to the wires and sat upon them and snuggled down as close to\\n\\nthem as they could get and listened hard, putting now the right ear down\\n\\nand now the left--but all they could ever hear was MUM-MUM-MUM-M-M-M-M.\\n\\n\\n\\n_And they seem never to have got over that habit!_ If you want to find\\n\\nout for yourself the truth of this tale, _you go_ some day when the wind\\n\\nis blowing against the wires and the birds are sitting upon them,\\n\\nsnuggled close, and put your ear to a telegraph pole and all _you_ will\\n\\nhear is MUM-MUM-MUM-M-M-M.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: CATHKA AND THE DEVIL]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 4: By permission of the publishers from _The City That Never\\n\\nWas Reached,_ by Dr. Jay T.

She had money besides but little good\\n\\nit did her because she was such an ill-tempered vixen that nobody, not\\n\\neven the poorest laborer, would marry her. Nobody would even work for\\n\\nher, no matter what she paid, for she couldn\\'t open her mouth without\\n\\nscolding, and whenever she scolded she raised her shrill voice until you\\n\\ncould hear it a mile away. The older she grew the worse she became until\\n\\nby the time she was forty she was as sour as vinegar.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow as it always happens in a village, every Sunday afternoon there was\\n\\na dance either at the burgomaster\\'s, or at the tavern. As soon as the\\n\\nbagpipes sounded, the boys all crowded into the room and the girls\\n\\ngathered outside and looked in the windows. Katcha was always the first\\n\\nat the window. The music would strike up and the boys would beckon the\\n\\ngirls to come in and dance, but no one ever beckoned Katcha. Even when\\n\\nshe paid the piper no one ever asked her to dance. Yet she came Sunday\\n\\nafter Sunday just the same.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne Sunday afternoon as she was hurrying to the tavern she thought to\\n\\nherself: \"Here I am getting old and yet I\\'ve never once danced with a\\n\\nboy! Plague take it, to-day I\\'d dance with the devil if he asked me!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was in a fine rage by the time she reached the tavern, where she sat\\n\\ndown near the stove and looked around to see what girls the boys had\\n\\ninvited to dance.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly a stranger in hunter\\'s green came in. He sat down at a table\\n\\nnear Katcha and ordered drink. When the serving maid brought the beer,\\n\\nhe reached over to Katcha and asked her to drink with him. At first she\\n\\nwas much taken back at this attention, then she pursed her lips coyly\\n\\nand pretended to refuse, but finally she accepted.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen they had finished drinking, he pulled a ducat from his pocket,\\n\\ntossed it to the piper, and called out:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Clear the floor, boys! This is for Katcha and me alone!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe boys snickered and the girls giggled, hiding behind each other and\\n\\nstuffing their aprons into their mouths so that Katcha wouldn\\'t hear\\n\\nthem laughing. But Katcha wasn\\'t noticing them at all. Katcha was\\n\\ndancing with a fine young man! If the whole world had been laughing at\\n\\nher, Katcha wouldn\\'t have cared.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe stranger danced with Katcha all afternoon and all evening. Not once\\n\\ndid he dance with any one else. He bought her marzipan and sweet drinks\\n\\nand, when the hour came to go home, he escorted her through the village.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah,\" sighed Katcha when they reached her cottage and it was time to\\n\\npart, \"I wish I could dance with you forever!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said the stranger. \"Come with me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where do you live?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Put your arm around my neck and I\\'ll tell you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nKatcha put both arms about his neck and instantly the man changed into a\\n\\ndevil and flew straight down to hell.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the gates of hell he stopped and knocked.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis comrades came and opened the gates and when they saw that he was\\n\\nexhausted, they tried to take Katcha off his neck. But Katcha held on\\n\\ntight and nothing they could do or say would make her budge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe devil finally had to appear before the Prince of Darkness himself\\n\\nwith Katcha still glued to his neck.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s that thing you\\'ve got around your neck?\" the Prince asked.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the devil told how as he was walking about on earth he had heard\\n\\nKatcha say she would dance with the devil himself if he asked her. \"So I\\n\\nasked her to dance with me,\" the devil said. \"Afterwards just to\\n\\nfrighten her a little I brought her down to hell. And now she won\\'t let\\n\\ngo of me!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Serve you right, you dunce!\" the Prince said. \"How often have I told\\n\\nyou to use common sense when you go wandering around on earth! You might\\n\\nhave known Katcha would never let go of a man once she had him!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I beg your Majesty to make her let go!\" the poor devil implored.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I will not!\" said the Prince. \"You\\'ll have to carry her back to earth\\n\\nyourself and get rid of her as best you can. Perhaps this will be a\\n\\nlesson to you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the devil, very tired and very cross, shambled back to earth with\\n\\nKatcha still clinging to his neck. He tried every way to get her off. He\\n\\npromised her wooded hills and rich meadows if she but let him go. He\\n\\ncajoled her, he cursed her, but all to no avail. Katcha still held on.\\n\\n\\n\\nBreathless and discouraged he came at last to a meadow where a\\n\\nshepherd, wrapped in a great shaggy sheepskin coat, was tending his\\n\\nflocks. The devil transformed himself into an ordinary looking man so\\n\\nthat the shepherd didn\\'t recognize him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hi, there,\" the shepherd said, \"what\\'s that you\\'re carrying?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t ask me,\" the devil said with a sigh. \"I\\'m so worn out I\\'m nearly\\n\\ndead. I was walking yonder not thinking of anything at all when along\\n\\ncomes a woman and jumps on my back and won\\'t let go. I\\'m trying to carry\\n\\nher to the nearest village to get rid of her there, but I don\\'t believe\\n\\nI\\'m able. My legs are giving out.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe shepherd, who was a good-natured chap, said: \"I tell you what: I\\'ll\\n\\nhelp you. I can\\'t leave my sheep long, but I\\'ll carry her halfway.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said the devil, \"I\\'d be very grateful if you did!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the shepherd yelled at Katcha: \"Hi, there, you! Catch hold of me!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Katcha saw that the shepherd was a handsome youth, she let go of\\n\\nthe devil and leapt upon the shepherd\\'s back, catching hold of the\\n\\ncollar of his sheepskin coat.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow the young shepherd soon found that the long shaggy coat and Katcha\\n\\nmade a pretty heavy load for walking. In a few moments he was sick of\\n\\nhis bargain and began casting about for some way of getting rid of\\n\\nKatcha.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently he came to a pond and he thought to himself that he\\'d like to\\n\\nthrow her in. He wondered how he could do it. Perhaps he could manage it\\n\\nby throwing in his greatcoat with her. The coat was so loose that he\\n\\nthought he could slip out of it without Katcha\\'s discovering what he was\\n\\ndoing. Very cautiously he slipped out one arm. Katcha didn\\'t move. He\\n\\nslipped out the other arm. Still Katcha didn\\'t move. He unlooped the\\n\\nfirst button. Katcha noticed nothing. He unlooped the second button.\\n\\nStill Katcha noticed nothing. He unlooped the third button and kerplunk!\\n\\nhe had pitched coat and Katcha and all into the middle of the pond!\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he got back to his sheep, the devil looked at him in amazement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Katcha?\" he gasped.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh,\" the shepherd said, pointing over his shoulder with his thumb, \"I\\n\\ndecided to leave her up yonder in a pond.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My dear friend,\" the devil cried, \"I thank you! You have done me a\\n\\ngreat favor. If it hadn\\'t been for you I might be carrying Katcha till\\n\\ndooms-day. I\\'ll never forget you and some time I\\'ll reward you. As you\\n\\ndon\\'t know who it is you\\'ve helped, I must tell you I\\'m a devil.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWith these words the devil vanished.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment the shepherd was dazed. Then he laughed and said to\\n\\nhimself: \"Well, if they\\'re all as stupid as he is, we ought to be able\\n\\nfor them!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe country where the shepherd lived was ruled over by a dissolute young\\n\\nduke who passed his days in riotous living and his nights in carousing.\\n\\nHe gave over the affairs of state to two governors who were as bad as\\n\\nhe. With extortionate taxes and unjust fines they robbed the people\\n\\nuntil the whole land was crying out against them.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow one day for amusement the duke summoned an astrologer to court and\\n\\nordered him to read in the planets the fate of himself and his two\\n\\ngovernors. When the astrologer had cast a horoscope for each of the\\n\\nthree reprobates, he was greatly disturbed and tried to dissuade the\\n\\nduke from questioning him further.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Such danger,\" he said, \"threatens your life and the lives of your two\\n\\ngovernors that I fear to speak.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Whatever it is,\" said the duke, \"speak. But I warn you to speak the\\n\\ntruth, for if what you say does not come to pass you will forfeit your\\n\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe astrologer bowed and said: \"Hear then, O Duke, what the planets\\n\\nforetell: Before the second quarter of the moon, on such and such a day,\\n\\nat such and such an hour, a devil will come and carry off the two\\n\\ngovernors. At the full of the moon on such and such a day, at such and\\n\\nsuch an hour, the same devil will come for your Highness and carry you\\n\\noff to hell.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe duke pretended to be unconcerned but in his heart he was deeply\\n\\nshaken. The voice of the astrologer sounded to him like the voice of\\n\\njudgment and for the first time conscience began to trouble him.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for the governors, they couldn\\'t eat a bite of food and were carried\\n\\nfrom the palace half dead with fright. They piled their ill-gotten\\n\\nwealth into wagons and rode away to their castles, where they barred all\\n\\nthe doors and windows in order to keep the devil out.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe duke reformed. He gave up his evil ways and corrected the abuses of\\n\\nstate in the hope of averting if possible his cruel fate.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe poor shepherd had no inkling of any of these things. He tended his\\n\\nflocks from day to day and never bothered his head about the happenings\\n\\nin the great world.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly one day the devil appeared before him and said: \"I have come,\\n\\nmy friend, to repay you for your kindness. When the moon is in its first\\n\\nquarter, I was to carry off the former governors of this land because\\n\\nthey robbed the poor and gave the duke evil counsel. However, they\\'re\\n\\nbehaving themselves now so they\\'re to be given another chance. But they\\n\\ndon\\'t know this. Now on such and such a day do you go to the first\\n\\ncastle where a crowd of people will be assembled. When a cry goes up and\\n\\nthe gates open and I come dragging out the governor, do you step up to\\n\\nme and say: \\'What do you mean by this? Get out of here or there\\'ll be\\n\\ntrouble!\\' I\\'ll pretend to be greatly frightened and make off. Then ask\\n\\nthe governor to pay you two bags of gold, and if he haggles just\\n\\nthreaten to call me back. After that go on to the castle of the second\\n\\ngovernor and do the same thing and demand the same pay. I warn you,\\n\\nthough, be prudent with the money and use it only for good. When the\\n\\nmoon is full, I\\'m to carry off the duke himself, for he was so wicked\\n\\nthat he\\'s to have no second chance. So don\\'t try to save him, for if you\\n\\ndo you\\'ll pay for it with your own skin. Don\\'t forget!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe shepherd remembered carefully everything the devil told him. When\\n\\nthe moon was in its first quarter he went to the first castle. A great\\n\\ncrowd of people was gathered outside waiting to see the devil carry away\\n\\nthe governor.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly there was a loud cry of despair, the gates of the castle\\n\\nopened, and there was the devil, as black as night, dragging out the\\n\\ngovernor. He, poor man, was half dead with fright.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe shepherd elbowed his way through the crowd, took the governor by the\\n\\nhand, and pushed the devil roughly aside.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What do you mean by this?\" he shouted. \"Get out of here or there\\'ll be\\n\\ntrouble!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nInstantly the devil fled and the governor fell on his knees before the\\n\\nshepherd and kissed his hands and begged him to state what he wanted in\\n\\nreward. When the shepherd asked for two bags of gold, the governor\\n\\nordered that they be given him without delay.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the shepherd went to the castle of the second governor and went\\n\\nthrough exactly the same performance.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt goes without saying that the duke soon heard of the shepherd, for he\\n\\nhad been anxiously awaiting the fate of the two governors. At once he\\n\\nsent a wagon with four horses to fetch the shepherd to the palace and\\n\\nwhen the shepherd arrived he begged him piteously to rescue him\\n\\nlikewise from the devil\\'s clutches.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Master,\" the shepherd answered, \"I cannot promise you anything. I have\\n\\nto consider my own safety. You have been a great sinner, but if you\\n\\nreally want to reform, if you really want to rule your people justly and\\n\\nkindly and wisely as becomes a true ruler, then indeed I will help you\\n\\neven if I have to suffer hellfire in your place.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe duke declared that with God\\'s help he would mend his ways and the\\n\\nshepherd promised to come back on the fatal day.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith grief and dread the whole country awaited the coming of the full\\n\\nmoon. In the first place the people had greeted the astrologer\\'s\\n\\nprophecy with joy, but since the duke had reformed their feelings for\\n\\nhim had changed.\\n\\n\\n\\nTime sped fast as time does whether joy be coming or sorrow and all too\\n\\nsoon the fatal day arrived.\\n\\n\\n\\nDressed in black and pale with fright, the duke sat expecting the\\n\\narrival of the devil.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly the door flew open and the devil, black as night, stood before\\n\\nhim. He paused a moment and then he said, politely:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Your time has come, Lord Duke, and I am here to get you!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWithout a word the duke arose and followed the devil to the courtyard,\\n\\nwhich was filled with a great multitude of people.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt that moment the shepherd, all out of breath, came pushing his way\\n\\nthrough the crowd, and ran straight at the devil, shouting out:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What do you mean by this? Get out of here or there\\'ll be trouble!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What do _you_ mean?\" whispered the devil. \"Don\\'t you remember what I\\n\\ntold you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hush!\" the shepherd whispered back. \"I don\\'t care anything about the\\n\\nduke. This is to warn you! You know Katcha? She\\'s alive and she\\'s\\n\\nlooking for you!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe instant the devil heard the name of Katcha he turned and fled.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll the people cheered the shepherd, while the shepherd himself laughed\\n\\nin his sleeve to think that he had taken in the devil so easily.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for the duke, he was so grateful to the shepherd that he made him his\\n\\nchief counselor and loved him as a brother. And well he might, for the\\n\\nshepherd was a sensible man and always gave him sound advice.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Ilustration: THE WHITE DOGS OF ARRAN]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 5: From _Czechoslovak Fairy Tales_, by Parker Fillmore.\\n\\nCopyright by Harcourt, Brace & Company.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE WHITE DOGS OF ARRAN[6]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOR a long hour, on that November afternoon, my brother Ted had been\\n\\nstanding at the gate below the ranch house, waiting and waiting, while\\n\\nthe twilight filled the round hollow of the valley as water slowly fills\\n\\na cup. At last the figure of a rider, silhouetted against the\\n\\nrose-colored sky, came into view along the crest of the rocky ridge. The\\n\\nlittle cow pony was loping as swiftly as the rough trail would permit,\\n\\nbut to Ted\\'s impatient eyes it seemed to crawl as slowly as a fly on a\\n\\nwindow pane. Although the horseman looked like a cow puncher, at that\\n\\ndistance, with his slouch hat and big saddle, the eager boy knew that it\\n\\nwas the district doctor making his far rounds over the range. A swift\\n\\nepidemic had been sweeping over Montana, passing from one ranch to\\n\\nanother and leaving much illness and suffering behind. Ted\\'s uncle and\\n\\nthe cousin who was his own age had both been stricken two days before\\n\\nand it seemed that the doctor would never come.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad you are here,\" he said as the doctor\\'s pony, covered with foam\\n\\nand quivering with fatigue, passed through the open gate. \"We have two\\n\\npatients for you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe man nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Fever, I suppose,\" he commented, \"and aching bones, and don\\'t know what\\n\\nto make of themselves because they have never been sick before? I have\\n\\nseen a hundred such cases in the last few days. It is bad at all the\\n\\nranches, but the sheep herders, off in their cabins by themselves, are\\n\\nhit particularly hard.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe slipped from the saddle and strode into the house, leaving Ted to\\n\\ntake the tired pony around to the stables. It was very dark now and\\n\\ngrowing cold, but he felt warm and comforted, somehow, since the doctor\\n\\nhad come. He heard running feet behind him and felt a dog\\'s nose, cold\\n\\nand wet, thrust into his hand. It was Pedro, the giant, six months\\' old\\n\\nwolf hound puppy, long legged and shaggy haired, the pride of Ted\\'s life\\n\\nand the best beloved of all his possessions. The big dog followed his\\n\\nmaster into the stable and sat down, blinking solemnly in the circle of\\n\\nlantern light, while the boy was caring for the doctor\\'s horse and\\n\\nbedding it down. Ted\\'s thoughts were very busy, now with his anxieties\\n\\nabout his uncle, now racing out over the range to wonder how those in\\n\\nthe stricken ranch houses and lonely cabins might be faring. There was\\n\\nthe ranch on Arran Creek--people there were numerous enough to care for\\n\\neach other. It might be worse at Thompson\\'s Crossing, and, oh, how would\\n\\nit be with those shepherds who lived in tiny cottages here and there\\n\\nalong the Big Basin, so far from neighbors that often for months they\\n\\nsaw no other faces than the wooly vacant ones of their thousands of\\n\\nsheep.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was one, a big grizzled Irishman, whom Ted had seen only a few\\n\\ntimes. Nevertheless, he was one of his closest friends. They had met on\\n\\na night when the boy was hunting, and he could remember still how they\\n\\nhad lain together by the tiny camp fire, with the coyotes yelping in the\\n\\ndistance, with the great plain stretching out into the dark, with the\\n\\nslender curl of smoke rising straight upward and the big stars seeming\\n\\nalmost within reach of his hand in the thin air. The lonely Irishman had\\n\\nopened his heart to his new friend and had told him much of his own\\n\\ncountry, so unlike this big bare one, a dear green land where the\\n\\ntumbledown cottages and little fields were crowded together in such\\n\\ncomforting comradeship.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You could open your window of a summer night and give a call to the\\n\\nneighbors,\" he sighed, \"and you needn\\'t to have the voice of the giant\\n\\nFinn McCoul to make them hear. In this place a man could fall sick and\\n\\ndie alone and no one be the wiser.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHis reminiscences had wandered farther and farther until he began to\\n\\ntell the tales and legends familiar in his own countryside, stories of\\n\\nthe \"Little People\" and of Ireland in ancient times. Of them all Ted\\n\\nremembered most clearly the story of the white grayhounds of the King of\\n\\nConnemara, upon which his friend had dwelt long, showing that in spite\\n\\nof its being a thousand years old, it was his favorite tale.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Like those dogs on Arran Creek, they were perhaps,\" the Irishman said,\\n\\n\"only sleeker of coat and swifter of foot, I\\'m thinking.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But they couldn\\'t be faster,\" Ted had objected. \"The Arran dogs can\\n\\ncatch coyotes and jack-rabbits and people have called those the quickest\\n\\nanimals that run.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah,\" returned the other with true Irish logic, \"those Arran dogs are\\n\\nRussian, they tell me, and these I speak of were of Connemara, and what\\n\\ncomes out of Ireland, you may be sure, is faster and fairer than\\n\\nanything else on earth.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAgainst such reasoning Ted had judged it impossible to argue and had\\n\\ndropped into silence and finally into sleep with the voices of the\\n\\ncoyotes and the legend of the lean, white Irish grayhounds still running\\n\\nlike swift water through his dreams.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter that he had visited the lonely shepherd whenever he could find\\n\\ntime to travel so far. Together they had hunted deer and trapped beaver\\n\\nin the foothills above the Big Basin or, when the sheep had to be moved\\n\\nto new pasture, had spent hours in earnest talk, plodding patiently in\\n\\nthe dust after the slow-moving flock. The long habit of silence had\\n\\ntaken deep hold upon the Irishman, but with Ted alone he seemed willing\\n\\nto speak freely. It was on one of these occasions that he had given the\\n\\nboy the image of Saint Christopher, \"For,\" he said, \"you are like to be\\n\\na great roamer and a great traveler from the way you talk, and those who\\n\\ncarry the good Saint Christopher with them, always travel safely.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, as Ted thought of illness and pestilence spreading across the\\n\\nthinly settled state, his first and keenest apprehension was for the\\n\\nsafety of his friend. His work done, he went quickly back to the house\\n\\nwhere the doctor was already standing on the doorstep again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They are not bad cases, either of them,\" he was saying to Ted\\'s aunt.\\n\\n\"If they have good care there is no danger, but if they don\\'t--then\\n\\nHeaven help them, I can\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTed came close and pulled his sleeve.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tell me,\" he questioned quickly, \"Michael Martin isn\\'t sick, is he?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Michael Martin?\" repeated the doctor. \"A big Irishman in the cabin at\\n\\nthe upper edge of Big Basin? Yes, he\\'s down sick as can be, poor fellow,\\n\\nwith no one but a gray old collie dog, about the age of himself, I\\n\\nshould think, to keep him company.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe turned back to give a few last directions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I suppose you are master of the house with your uncle laid up,\" he said\\n\\nto Ted again, \"and I will have to apply to you to lend me a fresh horse\\n\\nso that I can go on.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re never going on to-night?\" exclaimed Ted; \"why, you have been\\n\\nriding for all you were worth, all day!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, and all the night before,\" returned the doctor cheerfully, \"but\\n\\nthis is no time to spare horses or doctors. Good gracious, boy, what\\'s\\n\\nthat?\" For Pedro, tall and white in the dark, standing on his hind legs\\n\\nto insert an inquisitive puppy nose between the doctor\\'s collar and his\\n\\nneck, was an unexpected and startling apparition.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s my dog,\" Ted explained proudly; \"Jim McKenzie, over on Arran\\n\\nCreek, gave him to me; he has a lot of them, you know. Pedro is only\\n\\nhalf grown now, he is going to be a lot bigger when he is a year old.\\n\\nYes, I\\'ll bring you a horse right away, yours couldn\\'t go another mile.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen, a few minutes later, the sound of hoofs came clattering up from\\n\\nthe stables it seemed certain that there were more than four of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s this?\" the doctor inquired, seeing a second horse with\\n\\nsaddlebags and blanket roll strapped in place and observing Ted\\'s boots\\n\\nand riding coat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My aunt and the girls will take care of Uncle,\" the boy replied, \"so I\\n\\nam going out to see Michael Martin. You can tell me what to do for him\\n\\nas we ride up the trail.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThey could feel the sharp wind almost before they began climbing the\\n\\nridge. So far, summer had lingered into November, but the weather was\\n\\nplainly changing now and there had been reports of heavy snowfalls in\\n\\nthe mountains. The stars shone dimly, as though through a veil of mist.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You had better push on as fast as you can,\" advised the doctor as they\\n\\ncame to the parting of their ways. \"When a man is as sick as Michael,\\n\\nwhat ever is to happen, comes quickly.\" His horse jumped and snorted.\\n\\n\"There\\'s that white puppy of yours again. What a ghost he is! He is\\n\\nrather big to take with you to a sick man\\'s cabin.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nPedro had come dashing up the trail behind them, in spite of his having\\n\\nbeen ordered sternly to stay at home. At six months old the sense of\\n\\nobedience is not quite so great as it should be, and the love of going\\n\\non an expedition is irresistible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It would take me forever to drive him home now,\" Ted admitted; \"I will\\n\\ntake him along to Jim McKenzie\\'s and leave him there with his brothers.\\n\\nI can make Arran Creek by breakfast time and ought to get to Michael\\'s\\n\\nnot long after noon. Well, so long!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe stars grew more dim and the wind keener as he rode on through the\\n\\nnight. His pony cantered steadily with the easy rocking-horse motion\\n\\nthat came near to lulling him to sleep. Pedro paddled alongside, his\\n\\nlong legs covering the miles with untiring energy. They stopped at\\n\\nmidnight to drink from the stream they were crossing, to rest a little\\n\\nand to eat some lunch from the saddlebags. Then they pressed on once\\n\\nmore, on and on, until gray and crimson began to show behind the\\n\\nmountains to the eastward, and the big white house of Arran at last\\n\\ncame into sight.\\n\\n\\n\\nJim McKenzie\\'s place was bigger than the ordinary ranch house, for there\\n\\nwere gabled roofs showing through the group of trees, there were tall\\n\\nbarns and a wide fenced paddock where lived the white Russian wolfhounds\\n\\nfor which the Arran ranch was famous. A deep-voiced chorus of welcome\\n\\nwas going up as Ted and Pedro came down the trail. The puppy responded\\n\\njoyfully and went bounding headlong to the foot of the slope to greet\\n\\nhis brothers. It was a beautiful sight to see the band of great dogs,\\n\\ntheir coats like silver in the early morning light, romping together\\n\\nlike a dozen kittens, pursuing each other in circles, checking,\\n\\nwheeling, rolling one another over, leaping back and forth over the low\\n\\nfences that divided the paddock, with the grace and free agility of\\n\\ndeer. Early as it was, Jim McKenzie was walking down to the stables and\\n\\nstopped to greet Ted as, weary and dusty, he rode through the gate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sure we\\'ll keep Pedro,\" he said when he had heard the boy\\'s errand.\\n\\n\"Yes, we\\'ve a good many sick here; I\\'d have sent out on the range myself\\n\\nbut there was nobody to spare. They tell me the herds of sheep are in\\n\\nterrible confusion, and most of the herders are down. Poor old Michael\\n\\nMartin, I hope you get there in time to help him. Turn your horse into\\n\\nthe corral, we\\'ll give you another to go on with. Now come in to\\n\\nbreakfast.\" Ted snatched a hurried meal, threw his saddle upon a fresh\\n\\npony, and set off again. For a long distance he could hear the\\n\\nlamentations of Pedro protesting loudly at the paddock gate. The way,\\n\\nafter he passed Arran Creek, led out into the flat country of the Big\\n\\nBasin with the sagebrush-dotted plain stretching far ahead. It seemed\\n\\nthat he rode endlessly and arrived nowhere, so long was the way and so\\n\\nunchanging the landscape. Once, as he crossed a stream, a deer rose,\\n\\nstamping and snorting among the low bushes, and fled away toward the\\n\\nhills, seeming scarcely to touch the ground as it went. Later, something\\n\\nquick and silent, and looking like a reddish-brown collie, leaped from\\n\\nthe sagebrush and scudded across the trail almost under his horse\\'s\\n\\nfeet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"A coyote, out in the open in daylight,\" he reflected, somewhat\\n\\nstartled. \"It must have been cold up in the mountains to make them so\\n\\nbold. That looks bad for the sheep.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was disturbing also to see how many scattered sheep he was beginning\\n\\nto pass, little bands, solitary ewes with half-grown lambs trotting at\\n\\ntheir heels, adventurous yearlings straying farther and farther from\\n\\ntheir comrades. Once or twice he tried to drive them together, but owing\\n\\nto his haste and his inexperience with their preposterous ways, he had\\n\\nvery little success.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There is going to be bad weather, too,\" he observed as he saw the blue\\n\\nsky disappear beneath an overcast of gray. \"I had better get on to\\n\\nMichael\\'s as fast as I can.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe saw the little mud and log cabin at last, tucked away among some\\n\\nstunted trees near the shoulder of a low ridge. It looked deceivingly\\n\\nnear, yet he rode and rode and could not reach it. White flakes were\\n\\nflying now, fitfully at first, then thicker and thicker until he could\\n\\nscarcely see. His growing misgivings gave place to greater and greater\\n\\nanxiety concerning his friend, while there ran through his mind again\\n\\nand again the doctor\\'s words, \"Whatever is to happen, comes quickly.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was past noon and had begun to seem as though he had been riding\\n\\nforever when he breasted the final slope at last, jumped from his horse,\\n\\nand thundered at the cabin door. The whine of a dog answered him from\\n\\nwithin, and a faint voice, broken but still audible, told him that\\n\\nMichael was alive. The cabin, so it seemed to him as he entered, was a\\n\\ngood ten degrees colder than it was outside. Poor Michael, helpless and\\n\\nshivering on the bunk in the corner, looked like the shrunken ghost of\\n\\nthe giant Irishman he had known before. Ted rekindled the fire, emptied\\n\\nhis saddlebags, piled his extra blankets upon the bed and, with a skill\\n\\nbred of long practice in camp cookery, set about preparing a meal.\\n\\nMichael was so hoarse as to be almost unable to speak and so weak that\\n\\nhis mind wandered in the midst of a sentence, yet all of his thoughts\\n\\nwere on the care of his sheep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"When I felt the sickness coming on me I tried to drive them in,\" he\\n\\nwhispered, \"but they broke and scattered and I fell beside the\\n\\ntrail--they must get in--snow coming--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIn an hour his fever rose again, he tossed and muttered with only\\n\\nfleeting intervals of consciousness. Ted had found food and shelter for\\n\\nhis horse in the sheep shed, and had settled down to his task of anxious\\n\\nwatching. The snow fell faster and faster so that darkness came on by\\n\\nmid-afternoon. He had tried to drive the old collie dog out to herd in\\n\\nthe sheep, but the poor old creature would not leave its master and,\\n\\neven when pushed outside, remained whining beside the door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He couldn\\'t do much anyway,\" sighed Ted as he let him in again. \"How\\n\\nthose coyotes yelp! I wish, after all, that I had brought Pedro.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMichael had heard the coyotes too and was striving feebly to rise from\\n\\nhis bed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I must go out to them, my poor creatures,\" he gasped. \"Those devil\\n\\nbeasts will have driven them over the whole country before morning.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut he fell back, too weak to move farther, and was silent a long time.\\n\\nWhen he did speak it was almost aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"With the cold and the snow, I\\'m thinking there will be worse things\\n\\nabroad this night than just the coyotes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe lay very still while Ted sat beside him, beginning to feel sleepy and\\n\\nblinking at the firelight. Eleven o\\'clock, twelve, one, the slow hands\\n\\nof his watch pointed to the crawling hours. Michael was not asleep but\\n\\nhe said nothing, he was listening too intently. It was after one and the\\n\\nboy might have been dozing, when the old man spoke again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hark,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment Ted could hear nothing save the pat-pat of the snow\\n\\nagainst the window, but the collie dog bristled and growled as he lay\\n\\nupon the hearth and pricked his ears sharply. Then the boy heard it\\n\\ntoo, a faint cry and far off, not the sharp yelping of the coyotes,\\n\\nthough that was ominous enough, but the long hungry howl of a timber\\n\\nwolf. Tears of weakness and terror were running down the Irishman\\'s\\n\\nface.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My poor sheep, I must save them,\" he cried. \"What\\'s the value of a\\n\\nman\\'s life alongside of the creatures that\\'s trusted him. Those\\n\\nmurderers will have every one of them killed for me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTed jumped up quickly and bundled on his coat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where\\'s your rifle, Michael?\" he asked. \"I don\\'t know much about sheep,\\n\\nbut I will do what I can.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The rifle?\" returned Michael doubtfully. \"Now, I had it on my shoulder\\n\\nthe day I went out with the sickness on me, and it is in my mind that I\\n\\ndid not bring it home again. But there is the little gun hanging on the\\n\\nnail; there\\'s no more shells for it but there\\'s two shots still left in\\n\\nthe chamber.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe boy took down the rusty revolver and spun the cylinder with a\\n\\npractised finger.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Two shots is right,\" he said, \"and you have no more shells? Well, two\\n\\nshots may scare a wolf.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIf Michael had been in his proper senses, Ted very well knew, he would\\n\\nnever have permitted, without protest, such an expedition as the boy\\n\\nwas planning. As it was, however, he lay back in his bunk again, his\\n\\nmind wandering off once more into feverish dreams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If it was in the Old Country,\" he muttered, \"the very Little People\\n\\nthemselves would rise up to help a man in such a plight. You could be\\n\\nfeeling the rush of their wings in the air and could hear the cry of the\\n\\nfairy hounds across the hills. America is a good country, but, ah--it\\'s\\n\\nnot the same!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHoping to quiet him, Ted took the little Saint Christopher from his\\n\\npocket and laid it in the sick man\\'s hand. Then he finished strapping\\n\\nhis big boots, opened the door and slipped out quietly. Michael scarcely\\n\\nnoticed his going.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe snow had fallen without drifting much, nor was it yet very deep. He\\n\\nhurried down the slope, not quite knowing what he was to do, thinking\\n\\nthat at least he would gather as many sheep as he could and drive them\\n\\nhomeward. But there were no sheep to be found. Where so many had been\\n\\nscattered that afternoon there was now not one. The whole of the Big\\n\\nBasin seemed suddenly to have emptied of them. Presently, however, he\\n\\nfound a broad trail of trampled snow which he followed, where it led\\n\\nalong a tiny stream at the foot of the bridge. As he turned, he heard\\n\\nagain that long, terrifying howl coming down the wind. The sheep,\\n\\nperverse enough to scatter to the four winds when their master sought to\\n\\ndrive them in, had now, it seemed, gathered of their own will when so\\n\\ngreat a danger threatened. Ted came upon them at last, huddled together\\n\\nin a little ravine where the sparse undergrowth gave some shelter from\\n\\nthe snow. He could just see them in the dim light, their gray compact\\n\\nbodies crowded close, their foolish black faces seeming to look\\n\\npiteously to him for help. They were very quiet, although now and then\\n\\nthey would shift a little, stamp, and move closer. The cry of the wolf\\n\\nwas stilled at last, but not because the fierce marauder was not drawing\\n\\nnearer.\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, as he stood watching, there slipped a swift dark shape over the\\n\\nopposite edge of the hollow and flung itself upon a straggling ewe on\\n\\nthe outskirts of the flock. It was followed by a second silent shadow,\\n\\nand a third. The poor sheep gave only one frantic bleat, then all was\\n\\nstill again save for the sound of a hideous snapping and tearing, of a\\n\\nfurious struggle muffled in the soft depths of the snow. Ted raised the\\n\\nrevolver and took careful aim, he pulled the trigger, but no explosion\\n\\nfollowed. Michael\\'s improvidence in letting his stock dwindle to only\\n\\ntwo cartridges might be counted upon also to have let those two be damp.\\n\\nHelplessly the boy spun the cylinder and snapped the hammer again and\\n\\nagain, but to no purpose.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sheep was down now, with one of the savage hunters standing over it,\\n\\nanother tearing at its throat while the third was slipping along the\\n\\nedge of the flock selecting a fresh victim. Ted\\'s weapon was useless,\\n\\nyet he must do something, he could not stand and see the whole herd\\n\\ndestroyed before his eyes. Perhaps he could frighten them away as one\\n\\ncould coyotes: he was so angry at this senseless, brutal slaughter that\\n\\nhe lost all sense of prudence. He waved his arms up and down and shouted\\n\\nat the top of his lungs. He saw the creatures drop their prey and turn\\n\\nto look up at him. He ran along the slope, still shouting, then, of a\\n\\nsudden, stepped into an unexpected hollow, lost his balance and fell\\n\\nheadlong. One of the wolves left the flock and came creeping swiftly\\n\\ntoward him, its belly dragging in the snow.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis cry must have carried far in the quiet of the night for it was\\n\\nanswered from a great way off. A deep voice broke the stillness and\\n\\nanother, the call of coursing hounds who have winded their quarry but\\n\\nhave not yet found its trail. And mingled with the barking chorus there\\n\\nrose high the joyful yelp of a puppy who seeks his beloved master.\\n\\n\\n\\nTed, slipping in the snow, struggled to his knees and called again and\\n\\nagain. The stealthy, approaching shadow crept a yard nearer, then paused\\n\\nto lift a gray muzzle and sniff the air. The second wolf, with\\n\\nslobbering bloody jaws, turned to listen, the flock of sheep snorted and\\n\\nstamped in the snow.\\n\\n\\n\\nA minute passed, then another. The boy managed to get to his feet. Then\\n\\nacross the edge of the hollow, white against the dark underbrush, he saw\\n\\nthe dogs coming, a line of swift, leaping forms, huge, shaggy and\\n\\nbeautiful, their great voices all giving tongue together. Down the slope\\n\\nthey came like an avalanche, only one separating himself from the others\\n\\nfor a moment to fling himself upon Ted, to lick his face in ecstatic\\n\\ngreeting and to rub a cold nose against his cheek. That nimble puppy\\n\\nnose it was that had lifted the latch of a gate not too securely\\n\\nfastened, and so set the whole pack free. Then Pedro ran to join his\\n\\nbrothers who were sweeping on to battle. Wolfhounds are taught to catch,\\n\\nnot to kill their quarry, but the thirst for blood was in the hearts of\\n\\nthe dogs of Arran that night. There was only a moment of struggle, a\\n\\nfew choking cries, and the fight was over.\\n\\n\\n\\nDay broke next morning, clear and bright, with the chinook blowing, the\\n\\nbig warm wind that melts the snows and lays the white hills bare almost\\n\\nin an hour. Michael Martin, fallen into a proper sleep at last, woke\\n\\nsuddenly and sat up in his bunk. He startled Ted, who, rather stiff and\\n\\nsore from his night\\'s adventures, was kneeling by the fire preparing\\n\\nbreakfast. The boy came quickly to his patient\\'s side to inquire how he\\n\\ndid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s better I am in body,\" the Irishman answered; \"indeed I begin to\\n\\nfeel almost like a whole man again. But--\" he shook his head sadly, \"my\\n\\npoor wits, they\\'re gone away entirely.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMichael sighed deeply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"After you were gone last night,\" he answered, \"even my wandering senses\\n\\nhad an inkling of what a dangerous errand it was, and I got up from my\\n\\nbed and stumbled to the window to call you back. Yes, the sickness has\\n\\nmade me daft entirely, for as sure as I live, I saw the white grayhounds\\n\\nof Connemara go over the hill. But daft or no--\" he sniffed at the odor\\n\\nof frying bacon that rose from the hearth, \"I am going to relish my\\n\\nbreakfast this day. Eh, glory me, if there isn\\'t another of the\\n\\ncreatures now!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Pedro, once more applying a knowing muzzle to the clumsy latch, had\\n\\npushed open the door and stood upon the step, wagging and apologetic,\\n\\nthe morning sun shining behind him. Long-legged and awkward, he stepped\\n\\nover the threshold and came to the bedside to sniff inquisitively at the\\n\\nlittle silver image that lay on the blanket. Michael could never be\\n\\npersuaded to believe otherwise than that Saint Christopher had brought\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: WIND AN\\' WAVE AN\\' WANDHERIN\\' FLAME]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 6: Reprinted by permission of the publishers from _The Pool of\\n\\nStars_, by Cornelia Meigs.

Sure, \\'tis meself had nigh on forgot it\\n\\n     entirely, but when all\\'s quiet I\\'ll be afther tellin\\' it.\")\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHERE was always battlin\\' somewhere, back in those days; an\\' heroes that\\n\\nfought with sword an\\' spear--forged far up an\\' under the rainbow by Len\\n\\nthe Smith, that was mighty in all sorts o\\' wisdom.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow one time he was beatin\\' out a great shield o\\' gold; an\\' \\'twas\\n\\nwrought so cunnin\\' that who turned it over an\\' laid it on the wather\\n\\ncould step on it an\\' sail where he would. An\\' for a device on it he made\\n\\nroses o\\' the fine gold, raised far out from it, as they\\'d been growin\\'\\n\\nright there. Almost they seemed wavin\\' in the wind.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn\\' as he came to sthrikin\\' the last blows, his hand slipped, an\\' his\\n\\ngreat hammer went flyin\\' downward through the air; an\\' his cry o\\'\\n\\ncommand sent ringin\\' afther it was too late to hindher.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow \\'twas about toward sunset, an\\' the waves were beatin\\' high an\\' wild\\n\\nafther storm on the west coast, that Artan, son o\\' Duallach, that was a\\n\\nking\\'s son, was huntin\\' along the coast. All day he\\'d been tryin\\' to\\n\\nkeep from the company o\\' Myrdu, his half-brother, but only by now had he\\n\\nshaken him off; an\\' he was runnin\\' swiftly, for gladness o\\' bein\\' alone\\n\\nwith the breeze an\\' the flyin\\' spray.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust as the sinkin\\' sun touched the sea, he heard the great cryin\\'-out\\n\\no\\' Len, out o\\' the North, an\\' looked up into the deep sky. An\\' there he\\n\\nsaw, whirlin\\' down toward him, somethin\\' first dark an\\' then bright. Not\\n\\na fearin\\' thought was in him; an\\' as it came nigh he sprang with hand\\n\\nstretched out an\\' caught it --just savin\\' it from bein\\' buried in the\\n\\nbeach sand.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe force of its fallin\\' sent him to his knees, but in a breath he was\\n\\non his feet again, lookin\\' at what he held. Sure, \\'twas nothin\\' less\\n\\nthan a great hammer, glowin\\' an\\' darkenin\\' by turns, as there had been\\n\\nlivin\\' fire within it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'n ever are ye, then?\" cried Artan, out o\\' the surprise, never\\n\\nthinkin\\' on gettin\\' an answer. Yet thrue an\\' at once came a whisperin\\'\\n\\nlike wind in pine forests far off--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The hammer o\\' Len.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"An\\' how\\'ll I get ye back to him, not knowin\\' where to find him?\" asked\\n\\nArtan. \"Sure, the winds must rise up an\\' blow me to the end o\\' the\\n\\nrainbow, where he sits, or I\\'ll never get there at all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe words were scarce past his lips when down across the hills came a\\n\\nwarm gust o\\' south wind--the last o\\' the storm--an\\' caught him up, still\\n\\nclingin\\' to the hammer, an\\' swept him upwards till he could see naught\\n\\nfor mist an\\' hurryin\\' clouds. Then came a feelin\\' o\\' sinkin\\', an\\' a\\n\\nsudden jar; an\\' there he was standin\\' on green turf, lookin\\' at white\\n\\nmountains, risin\\' higher nor aught he\\'d seen, an\\' between him an\\' them\\n\\nshimmered the rainbow itself, glowin\\' all colors in the light o\\' sunset.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ay, \\'tis aisy seein\\' where I am,\" laughed Artan, startin\\' toward it\\n\\nbravely.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a while he went on, an\\' at last he came nigh enough to see the\\n\\nmighty shape o\\' Len, standin\\' waitin\\' at his forge. An\\' while night was\\n\\nfast comin\\' on, an\\' the stars showin\\' out in the sky over all, yet the\\n\\nsunfire was still flamin\\' up in his smithy, workin\\' his will at a\\n\\nword.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf fear had had place in the heart of Artan, then was time for it, when\\n\\nhe saw the deep eyes o\\' Len, like dark sea-water in caves, lookin\\' far\\n\\nan\\' through him. But never had that come to him, an\\' without speakin\\'\\n\\nhe raised the hammer toward the sthrong knotted hand that claimed it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Whist, then!\" says Len, graspin\\' it quick for fear the metal was\\n\\ncoolin\\'. \"Say naught till I\\'m done!\" With that he beat an\\' turned the\\n\\nshield, an\\' gave the endin\\' touches to it. Then, with another big shout,\\n\\nhe hung it on the rainbow, flashin\\' an\\' shinin\\' till men on earth below\\n\\nsaw it for Northern Lights in the night sky.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How came ye here in me forge, Artan, son o\\' Duallach?\" he cried.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That I know not,\" spoke out Artan. \"When I held yon hammer in hand, an\\'\\n\\ncried on the wind for blowin\\' me to him that owned it--for no other road\\n\\nthere was for returnin\\' it--the warm blast came out o\\' the south an\\'\\n\\ncaught me up here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ay,\" laughed Len, deep an\\' hearty. \"The winds are at the will o\\' him\\n\\nthat handles it; but too great a power is that to be given careless to\\n\\nmortal man. What reward will ye have, now? Whether gold, or power above\\n\\nother men, or the fairest o\\' maids for yer wife?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the blood reddened the face of Artan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Naught care I for gold,\" says he. \"An\\' power over men should be for him\\n\\nthat wins it fair.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then \\'tis the fairest o\\' maids ye\\'ll be afther wantin\\'?\" asked Len.\\n\\n\"Have ye seen such a one?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nay,\" says Artan. \"Dark are the faces in the house o\\' Duallach, an\\'\\n\\nlittle to me likin\\'.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then shall ye have one fair as day,\" says Len. He turned to where the\\n\\nshield was hangin\\', an\\' from the heart o\\' that same he plucked a rose o\\'\\n\\nthe beaten gold, an\\' gave it to Artan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Cast it in the sea surf at sunrise,\" says he, \"callin\\'\\n\\n\\'Darthuil!\\'--then shall ye have yer reward. But one thing mind. Safely\\n\\nyer own is she not till first lost an\\' won back. When ye know not where\\n\\nto seek aid in searchin\\', cry on me name at the sea-coast, an\\' aid will\\n\\nthere be for ye if ye come not too late--wind, wave, an\\' wandherin\\'\\n\\nflame. Never does Len forget. Hold fast yer rose.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he spoke, again came a gale, chill from the north this time, an\\'\\n\\nwhirled Artan past cloud an\\' above surgin\\' seas, an\\' left him on the\\n\\nhilltop above the beach at the last hour before the dawnin\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuick Artan hastened down the cliff, still graspin\\' the golden rose, an\\'\\n\\nstood where the little small waves curled over the stones, waitin\\' for\\n\\nthe first gleam o\\' the sun to touch the sea. Hours it seemed to him, but\\n\\nminutes it was in truth, before he caught a long breath, raised the\\n\\nrose high in air, an\\' tossed it swift an\\' sure into the snowy crest of a\\n\\ngreen incomin\\' wave.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Darthuil!\" he cried, an\\' the cliff echo made a song of it.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the drops flew upward in the red dawn an\\' the breaker swept in, there\\n\\nby his side stood a maid with the gold o\\' the rose in her hair, an\\' the\\n\\nwhite o\\' sea-foam in her fair skin, an\\' the color o\\' the sunrise in lips\\n\\nan\\' cheek. Blither nor spring, he caught her hand an\\' led her over the\\n\\nhills to the house o\\' Duallach, they two singin\\' for joy o\\' livin\\' as\\n\\nthey went.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow not long had the two been wed (an\\' welcome were they under the roof\\n\\nof Duallach), when Myrdu, that was half-brother to Artan, but older nor\\n\\nhim, came back from far huntin\\', ill-pleased at missin\\' Artan for his\\n\\ncompanion, an\\' for helpin\\' him carry the red deer he\\'d shot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Tis an ill youth,\" says he, \"an\\' will get no good from lyin\\' on the\\n\\ncliff edge an\\' lettin\\' the hunt go by.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nay,\" says Duallach, slow to anger. \"Fair fortune has he won, an\\' the\\n\\nfavor o\\' the gods; an\\' has brought home a bride, fair as the sun at\\n\\nnoon.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen was Myrdu half ragin\\' from bein\\' jealous; but not wishin\\' to show\\n\\nthat same, he called for meat an\\' dhrink to be brought him in the great\\n\\nhall. An\\' Artan, wishin\\' to be friendly like, cried out for Darthuil to\\n\\nserve his brother. Sure, when Myrdu saw her comin\\' toward him--shinin\\'\\n\\namong the dark lasses o\\' Duallach\\'s household like a star in the night\\n\\nsky--fury was in his heart for thinkin\\' that Artan, bein\\' younger nor\\n\\nhim, had won what he had not, an\\' soon he laid plans for stealin\\' her\\n\\nfrom his brother.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Twas not many days before word o\\' this came to the ear o\\' Duallach; an\\'\\n\\nhe, hatin\\' strife, bade Artan an\\' Darthuil take horse an\\' ride swiftly\\n\\nsouthward to the Lough o\\' the Lone Valley, to dwell on the little island\\n\\nin it till evil wishes had passed from the heart o\\' Myrdu. So Artan,\\n\\nmindin\\' what Len had foretold, yet thinkin\\' it wiser not to be afther\\n\\nlosin\\' Darthuil at all, rode away with her on his left hand when Myrdu\\n\\nwas sleepin\\' an\\' not knowin\\' what was bein\\' done.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he roused an\\' found them gone, an\\' that none o\\' the house would say\\n\\nwhither, he was in a fine passion; but he made as if he was afther goin\\'\\n\\nhuntin\\', an\\' took his two fierce hounds an\\' went off to trace the road\\n\\nthey\\'d taken. An\\' sure enough, \\'twas not many hours before he was on\\n\\ntheir path.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow safer would it have been had Artan told Darthuil the full raison why\\n\\nhe was takin\\' her far into the shelter o\\' forest an\\' lough o\\' the\\n\\nwildherness; but she, trustin\\' him, asked naught, thinkin\\' no evil o\\'\\n\\nlivin\\' man. So scarce had Artan left her in the low cabin on the island\\n\\nan\\' gone off to hunt, than Myrdu pushed through the bushes, leavin\\' the\\n\\nhounds on the shore behind, an\\' floated himself out to the island on a\\n\\ncouple o\\' logs lashed with a thong o\\' deer-skin. Ay, but Darthuil was\\n\\nstartled, not dhreamin\\' why he\\'d come.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Tis Artan is hurt, an\\' afther sendin\\' me for ye,\" says Myrdu, lookin\\'\\n\\ndown unaisy like, from not wishin\\' to meet the rare clear eyes o\\' her.\\n\\n\"Come, an\\' I\\'ll take ye where he lies.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNot waitin\\' a moment was Darthuil, then, but hurried doin\\' as she was\\n\\nbid, never thinkin\\' what evil might be in store.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfther a few hours Artan came back through the trees, an\\' game a plenty\\n\\nhe\\'d found. He pulled out his boat o\\' skins, an\\' quick paddled back to\\n\\nthe island. But there he found no Darthuil; no, nor any sign o\\' her save\\n\\nthe little print o\\' her sandal by the wather\\'s edge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen came to his mind the promise o\\' Len. Never darin\\' to waste an hour\\n\\nsearchin\\' by himself, he ferried his horse across to the mainland,\\n\\nmounted, an\\' pushed for the sea. Never once did he stop for restin\\'\\n\\ntill he was standin\\' where the waves beat over him, where he had cried\\n\\non Darthuil, an\\' she had come to him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Len!\" he called. \"Yer aidin\\', Len! Darthuil is stolen from me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThere came a rumblin\\' o\\' thunder, an\\' on the shore stood a great figure,\\n\\nlike a pillar o\\' cloud reachin\\' half to the sky.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Never safe yer own till lost an\\' found, I said,\" came the deep voice.\\n\\n\"Now I give ye wild servants, a wind an\\' a wave an\\' a wandherin\\' flame\\n\\nfor helpin\\' ye to bring her safe again. Mind well that each will obey ye\\n\\nbut once, so call on them only when yer sharpest need comes. When ye\\'ve\\n\\nagain set the feet o\\' Darthuil safe in the hall o\\' Duallach, none can\\n\\ntake her from ye more. Now follow yer love. \\'Tis to the Northland has\\n\\nMyrdu carried her. Let him not pass the White Rocks, or wind an\\' wave\\n\\nan\\' flame will lose power to aid ye. Use yer wit, now, an\\' use it well.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nArtan would have spoken to thank him, but with the last word Len was no\\n\\nmore there; so he mounted again an\\' turned to the north; an\\' behind him\\n\\ncame the wind, whisperin\\' over the grass; an\\' the wave, runnin\\' up the\\n\\nsthream near at hand; an\\' the flame, creepin\\' among dhry leaves, but\\n\\nsettin\\' fire to naught else, its time not bein\\' come.\\n\\n\\n\\nTogether they all thraveled the betther part of a long day, an\\' late on\\n\\nArtan saw dust risin\\' ahead. \\'Twas a cloud that Myrdu had raised to hide\\n\\nthe way he was goin\\', an\\' beyond it he was ridin\\', carryin\\' Darthuil\\n\\nbefore him on his saddle o\\' skins, with the two hounds lopin\\' along\\n\\nbeside to fright her from tryin\\' to escape, an\\' to give warnin\\' of any\\n\\nfollowin\\'; while not many miles ahead were the White Rocks, that he was\\n\\npushin\\' to reach.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn hurried Artan, but his horse was wearied, an\\' little head could he\\n\\nmake. Moreover, the cloud o\\' dust left him uncertain o\\' what was hid. So\\n\\nhe thought well, an\\' chose wind to serve him first.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Go on, an\\' blow the dust far away, whisperin\\' courage to Darthuil the\\n\\nwhile,\" says he. An\\' at once the wind sped far ahead, obeyin\\' his\\n\\ncommand. When the two dogs felt it touch them, they cowered low; but\\n\\nDarthuil took heart, knowin\\' that help was at hand. An\\' the dust was no\\n\\nmore hidin\\' her from Artan, so she waved her hand an\\' called aloud to\\n\\nhim to ride in haste.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen Myrdu, fearin\\' that he might yet lose her, threw a handful o\\' twigs\\n\\nbehind him in the road; an\\' fallin\\' they turned into dead trees,\\n\\nstoppin\\' the way on all sides. But Artan well knew the way to clear his\\n\\npath.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Go forward!\" he cried to the wandherin\\' flame, \"an\\' leave not a trace\\n\\no\\' them!\" As he spoke, the flame swept up high in air, roarin\\' an\\'\\n\\nsmokin\\'; an\\' in half an instant naught remained o\\' the logs but a pile\\n\\no\\' smoldherin\\' ashes. But still was Myrdu fast nearin\\' his goal, an\\' had\\n\\none thing more for helpin\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe dropped a little sharp knife in the roadway; an\\' as it fell, it cut\\n\\ninto the dust, an\\' there opened a wide, terrible chasm, not to be\\n\\ncrossed by horse nor man. Then Artan grew clear desperate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wave!\" he shouted, \"bring Darthuil to me!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nUp then it rose, rollin\\' forward like flood-tide in spring; an\\' it\\n\\nfilled the gulf, an\\' swept away dogs an\\' horse an\\' Myrdu himself, that\\n\\nnone were heard of from that on; but Darthuil it floated gentle like, as\\n\\nshe had been a tuft o\\' thistle-down, back to Artan, waitin\\' for her.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe caught her an\\' clasped her close, an\\' turned his horse, an\\' never\\n\\nhalted till he led her safe into the hall o\\' Duallach, where none might\\n\\nsteal her from him again. An\\' there they lived happy all their lives.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut as for the wind an\\' the wave an\\' the wandherin\\' flame, so sweet an\\'\\n\\nfair was Darthuil that ne\\'er would they go from her to return to Len. To\\n\\nthe last o\\' her life the wind blew soft for her when \\'twas overly hot\\n\\nelsewhere, an\\' clear cool wather flowed up from the ground to save her\\n\\ndhrawin\\' any from the river, an\\' fire burned bright on her hearth\\n\\nwithout need o\\' plenishin\\'; an\\' all that for the love o\\' Darthuil, that\\n\\nwas made by Len out o\\' the foam tossed by the wind from the sea-wave,\\n\\nan\\' the wandherin\\' flame o\\' the sunrise.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: THE KING, THE QUEEN, AND THE BEE]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 7: Reprinted by special permission from _The Sons O\\' Cormac_,\\n\\nby Aldis Dunbar.

Dutton & Company.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE KING, THE QUEEN, AND THE BEE[8]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nON a bright summer\\'s day, when the sun beat down fiercely upon the heads\\n\\nof the people, King Solomon sought the shade of one of his favorite\\n\\ngardens. But even where the foliage on the trees was so thick that it\\n\\nseemed the sun\\'s rays could not penetrate, it was also hot. Not a breath\\n\\nof air was there to fan the monarch\\'s cheek, and he lay down on the\\n\\nthick grass and gazed through the branches of the trees at the blue sky.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This great heat makes me weary,\" said the King, and in a few minutes he\\n\\nhad quietly fallen into a deep sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll was still in the beautiful garden, except for the sound of a few\\n\\nhumming birds, the twittering of the moths whose many-colored wings\\n\\nlooked more beautiful than ever in the bright sunshine, and the buzzing\\n\\nof the bees. But even these sounds grew still as the fierce rays from\\n\\nthe sky grew hotter until all nature seemed hushed to rest. Only one\\n\\ntiny bee was left moving in the garden. It flew steadily from flower to\\n\\nflower, sipping the honey, until at length it began to feel overcome by\\n\\nthe heat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, dear! I wonder what is the matter with me,\" buzzed the little bee.\\n\\n\"This is the first time I have come out of the hive, and I do feel\\n\\nqueer. I hope I am not going to faint.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe little bee felt giddy, and after flying round and round dizzily for\\n\\na few minutes it fell and dropped right on to King Solomon\\'s nose.\\n\\nImmediately the King awoke with such a start that the little bee was\\n\\nfrightened almost out of its wits and flew straight back to the hive.\\n\\n\\n\\nKing Solomon sat up and looked round to see what it was that had\\n\\nawakened him so rudely. He felt a strange pain at the tip of his nose.\\n\\nHe rubbed it with his royal forefinger, but the pain increased.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttendants came rushing towards him and asked him what was the matter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I must have been stung on the nose by a bee,\" said the King angrily.\\n\\n\"Send for the Lord High Physician and the Keeper of the Court Plaister\\n\\nimmediately. I cannot have a blister on the tip of my nose. To-morrow I\\n\\nam to be visited by the Queen of Sheba, and it will not do to have a\\n\\nswollen nose tied up in a sling.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Lord High Physician came with his many assistants, each carrying a\\n\\nbox of ointment, or lint, or some other preparation which might be\\n\\nrequired. King Solomon\\'s nose, and especially the tip of it, was\\n\\nexamined most carefully through a microscope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is almost nothing,\" said the Lord High Physician reassuringly. \"It\\n\\nis just a tiny sting from a very little bee which did not leave its\\n\\nsting in the wound. It will be healed in an hour or two and the Queen of\\n\\nSheba will not be able to notice that anything at all is the matter\\n\\nto-morrow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But meanwhile it smarts,\" said King Solomon. \"I am seriously annoyed\\n\\nwith the little bee. How dared it sting me, King Solomon, monarch of all\\n\\nliving things on earth, in the air and in the waters. Knows it not that\\n\\nI am its Royal Master to whom all homage and respect is due?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe pain soon ceased, but His Majesty did not like the smell of the\\n\\ngreasy ointment which was put on his nose, and he determined that the\\n\\nbee should be brought before him for trial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Place the impudent little bee under arrest at once,\" he commanded, \"and\\n\\nbring it before me so that I may hear what it has to say.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But I know it not,\" returned the Lord High Chamberlain, to whom the\\n\\ncommand was given.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then summon the Queen bee before me in an hour and bid her bring the\\n\\nculprit,\" answered the monarch. \"Tell her that I shall hold all the bees\\n\\nguilty until the saucy little offender is produced before me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe order was carried to the hive by one of the butterflies in\\n\\nattendance on the King and spread consternation among the bees. Such a\\n\\nbuzzing there was that the butterfly said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Stop making that noise. If the King hears you, it will only make\\n\\nmatters worse.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Queen bee promised to obey King Solomon\\'s command, and in an hour\\n\\nshe made her appearance in state before the great throne. Slowly and\\n\\nwith much pomp, the Queen bee made her way to King Solomon. She was the\\n\\nlargest of the bees and was escorted by a bodyguard of twelve female\\n\\nbees who cleared the way before her, walking backwards and bowing\\n\\nconstantly with their faces to her.\\n\\n\\n\\nKing Solomon was surrounded by all his Court which included living\\n\\nbeings, fairies, demons, spirits, goblins, animals, birds and insects.\\n\\nAll raised their voices in a loud hurrah when His Majesty took his seat\\n\\non the Throne, and a very strange noise the Court made. The lions\\n\\nroared, the serpents hissed, the birds chirped, the fairies sang and the\\n\\ndemons howled. The goblins that had no voices could only grin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Silence!\" cried a herald. \"The Queen bee is requested to stand forth.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nStill attended by her twelve guards, the Queen bee approached the foot\\n\\nof the Throne and made obeisance to King Solomon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I, thy slave, the Queen bee,\" she buzzed, \"am here at thy bidding,\\n\\nmighty ruler, great and wise. Command and thou shalt be obeyed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is well,\" replied Solomon. \"Hast thou brought with thee the culprit,\\n\\nthe bee that did dare to attack my nose with its sting?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have, your Majesty,\" answered the Queen bee. \"It is a young bee that\\n\\nthis day did leave the hive for the first time. It has confessed to me.\\n\\nIt did not attack your Majesty wilfully, but by accident, owing to\\n\\ngiddiness caused by the heat, and it could not have injured your Majesty\\n\\nseriously, because it left not its sting in the wound. Be merciful,\\n\\ngracious King.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Fear not my judgment,\" said the King. \"Bid the bee stand forth.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTremblingly, the little bee stood at the foot of the Throne and bowed\\n\\nthree times to King Solomon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Knowest thou not,\" said the King, \"that I am thy royal master whose\\n\\nperson must be held sacred by all living things?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, gracious Majesty,\" buzzed the bee. \"Thy slave is aware of this. It\\n\\nwas but an accident, and it is the nature of thy slave, the bee, who is\\n\\nin duty bound to obey thy laws, to thrust forth its sting when in\\n\\ndanger. I thought I was in danger when I fell.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So was I, for I was beneath you,\" returned King Solomon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Punish me not,\" pleaded the bee. \"I am but one of your Majesty\\'s\\n\\nsmallest and humblest slaves, but even I may be of service to your\\n\\nMajesty some day.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThese words from the little bee made the whole Court laugh. Even the\\n\\ngoblins which could not speak grinned from ear to ear and rolled their\\n\\nbig eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Silence!\" commanded the King sternly. \"There is naught to laugh at in\\n\\nthe bee\\'s answer. It pleases me well. Go, thou art free. Some day I may\\n\\nneed thee.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe little bee bowed its head three times before the King and flew away,\\n\\nbuzzing happily.\\n\\n\\n\\nNext day it kept quite close to the Palace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I want to see the procession when the Queen of Sheba arrives,\" it\\n\\nsaid, \"and I also must be near the King in case His Majesty may want\\n\\nme.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIn great state, the beautiful Queen of Sheba, followed by hundreds of\\n\\nhandsomely robed attendants, approached King Solomon who was seated on\\n\\nhis Throne, surrounded by all his Court.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Great and mighty King of Israel,\" she said, curtseying low, \"I have\\n\\nheard of thy great wisdom and would fain put it to the test. Hitherto\\n\\nall questions put to thee hast thou answered without difficulty. But I\\n\\nhave sworn to puzzle thy wondrous wisdom with my woman\\'s wit. Be\\n\\nheedful.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Beauteous Queen of Sheba,\" returned King Solomon, rising and bowing in\\n\\nreturn to her curtsey, \"thou art as witty as thou art fair, and if thou\\n\\nart successful in puzzling me, thy triumph shall be duly rewarded. I\\n\\nwill load thee with rich presents and proclaim thy wit and wisdom to the\\n\\nwhole world.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I accept thy challenge,\" replied the Queen, \"and at once.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBehind Her Majesty stood two beautiful girl attendants, each holding a\\n\\nbouquet of flowers. The Queen of Sheba took the flowers, and holding a\\n\\nbouquet in each hand, said to King Solomon:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tell me, thou who art the wisest man on earth, which of these bunches\\n\\nof flowers is real and which artificial.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They are both beautiful and their fragrance delicious in the extreme,\"\\n\\nreplied King Solomon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah,\" said the Queen, \"but only one bunch has fragrance. Which is it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nKing Solomon looked at the flowers. Both bunches looked exactly alike.\\n\\nFrom where he sat, it was impossible to detect any difference. He did\\n\\nnot answer at once, and he knit his brows as if perplexed. The courtiers\\n\\nalso looked troubled. Never before had they seen the King hesitate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is it impossible for your Majesty to answer the question?\" the Queen\\n\\nasked.\\n\\n\\n\\nSolomon shook his head and smiled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Never yet has a problem baffled me,\" he said. \"Your Majesty shall be\\n\\nanswered, and correctly.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And at once,\" said the Queen of Sheba imperiously.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So be it,\" answered King Solomon, gazing thoughtfully round and raising\\n\\nhis magic scepter.\\n\\n\\n\\nImmediately he heard what no one else did, the faint buzzing of the tiny\\n\\nwings of the little bee which had settled on one of the window panes of\\n\\nthe Palace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bid that window be opened,\" he commanded, pointing to it with his\\n\\nscepter, \"and let the bee enter to obey my wish.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe window was promptly opened, and in flew the little bee. Straight\\n\\ntowards the Queen of Sheba it flew, and now its buzzing could be heard\\n\\nby all the courtiers, who eagerly watched its flight through the air.\\n\\nWithout any hesitation, it settled on the bouquet in the Queen\\'s left\\n\\nhand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thou hast my answer, fair Queen of Sheba,\" said King Solomon, rising,\\n\\n\"given to thee by one of the tiniest of my subjects. It has settled on\\n\\nthe flowers that are natural. The bouquet in your right hand is made by\\n\\nhuman hands.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe whole Court applauded the monarch\\'s wisdom in bidding the little bee\\n\\nhelp him out of his difficulty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Your Majesty is indeed the wisest man on earth,\" said the Queen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thanks, my little friend,\" said the King to the bee, and it flew away,\\n\\nbuzzing merrily.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: THE WELL OF THE WORLD\\'S END]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 8: From _Jewish Fairy Tales and Fables,_ by Aunt Naomi. Robert\\n\\nScott, London.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE WELL OF THE WORLD\\'S END[9]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nONCE upon a time, and a very good time it was, though it wasn\\'t in my\\n\\ntime, nor in your time, nor in any one else\\'s time, there was a girl\\n\\nwhose mother had died, and her father married again. And her stepmother\\n\\nhated her because she was more beautiful than herself, and she was very\\n\\ncruel to her. She used to make her do all the servant\\'s work, and never\\n\\nlet her have any peace.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last, one day, the stepmother thought to get rid of her altogether;\\n\\nso she handed her a sieve and said to her: \"Go, fill it at the Well of\\n\\nthe World\\'s End and bring it home to me full, or woe betide you.\" For\\n\\nshe thought she would never be able to find the Well of the World\\'s End,\\n\\nand, if she did, how could she bring home a sieve full of water?\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, the girl started off, and asked every one she met to tell her\\n\\nwhere was the Well of the World\\'s End. But nobody knew, and she didn\\'t\\n\\nknow what to do, when a queer little old woman, all bent double, told\\n\\nher where it was, and how she could get to it. So she did what the old\\n\\nwoman told her, and at last arrived at the Well of the World\\'s End. But\\n\\nwhen she dipped the sieve in the cold, cold water, it all ran out again.\\n\\nShe tried and she tried again, but every time it was the same; and at\\n\\nlast she sat down and cried as if her heart would break.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly she heard a croaking voice, and she looked up and saw a great\\n\\nfrog with goggle eyes looking at her and speaking to her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter, dearie?\" it said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, oh, dear,\" she said, \"my stepmother has sent me all this long\\n\\nway to fill this sieve with water from the Well of the World\\'s End, and\\n\\nI can\\'t fill it no how at all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the frog, \"if you promise me to do whatever I bid you for a\\n\\nwhole night long, I\\'ll tell you how to fill it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the girl agreed, and the frog said:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Stop it with moss and daub it with clay,\\n\\n    And then it will carry the water away\";\\n\\n\\n\\nand then it gave a hop, skip, and a jump, and went flop into the Well of\\n\\nthe World\\'s End.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the girl looked about for some moss, and lined the bottom of the\\n\\nsieve with it, and over that she put some clay, and then she dipped it\\n\\nonce again into the Well of the World\\'s End; and this time the water\\n\\ndidn\\'t run out, and she turned to go away.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust then the frog popped up its head out of the Well of the World\\'s\\n\\nEnd, and said: \"Remember your promise.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All right,\" said the girl; for, thought she, \"what harm can a frog do\\n\\nme?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo she went back to her stepmother, and brought the sieve full of water\\n\\nfrom the Well of the World\\'s End. The stepmother was angry as angry, but\\n\\nshe said nothing at all.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat very evening they heard something tap-tapping at the door low down,\\n\\nand a voice cried out:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Open the door, my hinny, my heart,\\n\\n      Open the door, my own darling;\\n\\n    Mind you the words that you and I spoke,\\n\\n      Down in the meadow, at the World\\'s End Well.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Whatever can that be?\" cried out the stepmother, and the girl had to\\n\\ntell her all about it, and what she had promised the frog.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Girls must keep their promises,\" said the stepmother. \"Go and open the\\n\\ndoor this instant.\" For she was glad the girl would have to obey a nasty\\n\\nfrog.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the girl went and opened the door, and there was the frog from the\\n\\nWell of the World\\'s End. And it hopped, and it hopped, and it jumped,\\n\\ntill it reached the girl, and then it said:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Lift me to your knee, my hinny, my heart;\\n\\n      Lift me to your knee, my own darling;\\n\\n    Remember the words you and I spake,\\n\\n      Down in the meadow by the World\\'s End Well.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the girl didn\\'t like to, till her stepmother said: \"Lift it up this\\n\\ninstant, you hussy! Girls must keep their promises!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo at last she lifted the frog up on to her lap, and it lay there for a\\n\\ntime, till at last it said:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Give me some supper, my hinny, my heart,\\n\\n      Give me some supper, my darling;\\n\\n    Remember the words you and I spake,\\n\\n      In the meadow, by the Well of the World\\'s End.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, she didn\\'t mind doing that, so she got it a bowl of milk and\\n\\nbread, and fed it well. And when the frog had finished, it said:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Go with me to bed, my hinny, my heart,\\n\\n      Go with me to bed, my own darling;\\n\\n    Mind you the words you spake to me,\\n\\n      Down by the cold well, so weary.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut that the girl wouldn\\'t do, till her stepmother said: \"Do what you\\n\\npromised, girl; girls must keep their promises. Do what you\\'re bid, or\\n\\nout you go, you and your froggie.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the girl took the frog with her to bed, and kept it as far away from\\n\\nher as she could. Well, just as the day was beginning to break what\\n\\nshould the frog say but:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Chop off my head, my hinny, my heart,\\n\\n      Chop off my head, my own darling;\\n\\n    Remember the promise you made to me,\\n\\n      Down by the cold well so weary.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAt first the girl wouldn\\'t, for she thought of what the frog had done\\n\\nfor her at the Well of the World\\'s End. But when the frog said the words\\n\\nover again, she went and took an ax and chopped off its head, and lo!\\n\\nand behold, there stood before her a handsome young prince, who told her\\n\\nthat he had been enchanted by a wicked magician, and he could never be\\n\\nunspelled till some girl would do his bidding for a whole night, and\\n\\nchop off his head at the end of it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe stepmother was surprised indeed when she found the young prince\\n\\ninstead of the nasty frog, and she wasn\\'t best pleased, you may be sure,\\n\\nwhen the prince told her that he was going to marry her stepdaughter\\n\\nbecause she had unspelled him. But married they were, and went away to\\n\\nlive in the castle of the king, his father, and all the stepmother had\\n\\nto console her was, that it was all through her that her stepdaughter\\n\\nwas married to a prince.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: WINGS]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 9: From _English Fairy Tales,_ by Joseph Jacobs.

The farmer\\'s daughter\\n\\ncame by and asked, \"What are you blubbering about?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t got any wings,\" cried the peasant girl. \"Oh, I wish I could\\n\\ngrow some wings.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You stupid!\" said the farmer\\'s daughter. \"Of course you haven\\'t got\\n\\nwings. What do you want wings for?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I want to fly up into the sky and sing my little songs there,\" answered\\n\\nthe little peasant girl.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the farmer\\'s daughter was angry, and said again, \"You stupid! How\\n\\ncan you ever expect to grow wings? Your father\\'s only a farm-laborer.\\n\\nThey might grow on me, but not on you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the farmer\\'s daughter had said that, she went away to the well,\\n\\nsprinkled some water on her shoulders, and stood out among the\\n\\nvegetables in the garden, waiting for her wings to sprout. She really\\n\\nbelieved the sun would bring them out quite soon.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut in a little while a merchant\\'s daughter came along the road and\\n\\ncalled out to the girl who was trying to grow wings in the garden, \"What\\n\\nare you doing standing out there, red face?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am growing wings,\" said the farmer\\'s daughter. \"I want to fly.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the merchant\\'s daughter laughed loudly, and cried out, \"You stupid\\n\\nfarm-girl; if you had wings they would only be a weight on your back.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe merchant\\'s daughter thought she knew who was most likely to grow\\n\\nwings. And when she went back to the town where she lived she bought\\n\\nsome olive-oil and rubbed it on her shoulders, and went out into the\\n\\ngarden and waited for her wings to grow.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy and by a young lady of the Court came along, and said to her, \"What\\n\\nare you doing out there, my child?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the tradesman\\'s daughter said that she was growing wings, the young\\n\\nlady\\'s face flushed and she looked quite vexed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s not for you to do,\" she said. \"It is only real ladies who can\\n\\ngrow wings.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd she went on home, and when she got indoors she filled a tub with\\n\\nmilk and bathed herself in it, and then went into her garden and stood\\n\\nin the sun and waited for her wings to come out. Presently a princess\\n\\npassed by the garden, and when she saw the young lady standing there she\\n\\nsent a servant to inquire what she was doing. The servant came back and\\n\\ntold her that as the young lady had wanted to be able to fly she had\\n\\nbathed herself in milk and was waiting for her wings to grow.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe princess laughed scornfully and exclaimed, \"What a foolish girl!\\n\\nShe\\'s giving herself trouble for nothing. No one who is not a princess\\n\\ncan ever grow wings.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe princess turned the matter over in her mind, and when she arrived at\\n\\nher father\\'s palace she went into her chamber, anointed herself with\\n\\nsweet-smelling perfumes, and then went down into the palace garden to\\n\\nwait for her wings to come.\\n\\n\\n\\nVery soon all the young girls in the country round about went out into\\n\\ntheir gardens and stood among the vegetables so that they might get\\n\\nwings.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Fairy of the Wings heard about this strange happening and she flew\\n\\ndown to earth, and, looking at the waiting girls, she said, \"If I give\\n\\nyou all wings and let you all go flying into the sky, who will want to\\n\\nstay at home to cook the porridge and look after the children? I had\\n\\nbetter give wings only to one of you, namely, to her who wanted them\\n\\nfirst of all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo wings grew from the little peasant girl\\'s shoulders, and she was able\\n\\nto fly up into the sky and sing.\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 10: From _The Sweet-Scented Name,_ by Fedor Sologub.

This girl was good as well as pretty. No one had\\n\\never seen her frown or heard her say a cross word, and young and old\\n\\nwere glad when they saw her coming.\\n\\n\\n\\nSnowflower had no relation in the world but a very old grandmother. . . .\\n\\nEvery evening, when the fire was heaped with the sticks she had\\n\\ngathered till it blazed and crackled up the cottage chimney, Dame\\n\\nFrostyface set aside her wheel, and told her a new story. Often did the\\n\\nlittle girl wonder where her grandmother had gathered so many stories,\\n\\nbut she soon learned that. One sunny morning, at the time of the\\n\\nswallows\\' coming, the dame rose up, put on the gray hood and mantle in\\n\\nwhich she carried her yarn to the fairs, and said, \"My child, I am going\\n\\na long journey to visit an aunt of mine, who lives far in the north\\n\\ncountry. I cannot take you with me, because my aunt is the crossest\\n\\nwoman alive, and never liked young people: but the hens will lay eggs\\n\\nfor you; there is barley-meal in the barrel; and, as you have been a\\n\\ngood girl, I\\'ll tell you what to do when you feel lonely. Lay your head\\n\\ngently down on the cushion of the arm-chair, and say, \\'Chair of my\\n\\ngrandmother, tell me a story.\\' It was made by a cunning fairy, who lived\\n\\nin the forest when I was young, and she gave it to me because she knew\\n\\nnobody could keep what they got hold of better. Remember, you must never\\n\\nask a story more than once in the day; and if there be any occasion to\\n\\ntravel, you have only to seat yourself in it, and say, \\'Chair of my\\n\\ngrandmother, take me such a way.\\' It will carry you wherever you wish;\\n\\nbut mind to oil the wheels before you set out, for I have sat on it\\n\\nthese forty years in that same corner.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving said this, Dame Frostyface set forth to see her aunt in the north\\n\\ncountry. Snowflower gathered firing and looked after the hens and cat as\\n\\nusual. She baked herself a cake or two of the barley-meal; but when the\\n\\nevening fell the cottage looked lonely. Then Snowflower remembered her\\n\\ngrandmother\\'s words, and, laying her head gently down, she said, \"Chair\\n\\nof my grandmother, tell me a story.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nScarce were the words spoken, when a clear voice from under the velvet\\n\\ncushion . . . said: _\"Listen to the story of the Christmas Cuckoo!\"_\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Once upon a time there stood in the midst of a bleak moor, in the north\\n\\ncountry, a certain village; all its inhabitants were poor, for their\\n\\nfields were barren, and they had little trade, but the poorest of them\\n\\nall were two brothers called Scrub and Spare, who followed the cobbler\\'s\\n\\ncraft, and had but one stall between them. It was a hut built of clay\\n\\nand wattles. The door was low and always open, for there was no window.\\n\\nThe roof did not entirely keep out the rain, and the only thing\\n\\ncomfortable about it was a wide hearth, for which the brothers could\\n\\nnever find wood enough to make a sufficient fire. There they worked in\\n\\nmost brotherly friendship, though with little encouragement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The people of that village were not extravagant in shoes, and better\\n\\ncobblers than Scrub and Spare might be found. Spiteful people said there\\n\\nwere no shoes so bad that they would not be worse for their mending.\\n\\nNevertheless Scrub and Spare managed to live between their own trade, a\\n\\nsmall barley field, and a cottage garden, till one unlucky day when a\\n\\nnew cobbler arrived in the village. He had lived in the capital city of\\n\\nthe kingdom, and, by his own account, cobbled for the queen and the\\n\\nprincesses. His awls were sharp, his lasts were new; he set up his stall\\n\\nin a neat cottage with two windows. The villagers soon found out that\\n\\none patch of his would wear two of the brothers\\'. In short, all the\\n\\nmending left Scrub and Spare, and went to the new cobbler. The season\\n\\nhad been wet and cold, their barley did not ripen well, and the cabbages\\n\\nnever half closed in the garden. So the brothers were poor that winter,\\n\\nand when Christmas came they had nothing to feast on but a barley loaf,\\n\\na piece of rusty bacon, and some small beer of their own brewing. Worse\\n\\nthan that, the snow was very deep, and they could get no firewood. Their\\n\\nhut stood at the end of the village, beyond it spread the bleak moor,\\n\\nnow all white and silent; but that moor had once been a forest, great\\n\\nroots of old trees were still to be found in it, loosened from the soil\\n\\nand laid bare by the winds and rains--one of these, a rough gnarled log,\\n\\nlay hard by their door, the half of it above the snow, and Spare said to\\n\\nhis brother:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Shall we sit here cold on Christmas while the great root lies yonder?\\n\\nLet us chop it up for firewood, the work will make us warm.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'No,\\' said Scrub; \\'it\\'s not right to chop wood on Christmas; besides,\\n\\nthat root is too hard to be broken with any hatchet.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Hard or not we must have a fire,\\' replied Spare. \\'Come, brother, help\\n\\nme in with it. Poor as we are, there is nobody in the village will have\\n\\nsuch a yule log as ours.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub liked a little grandeur, and in hopes of having a fine yule log,\\n\\nboth brothers strained and strove with all their might till, between\\n\\npulling and pushing, the great old root was safe on the hearth, and\\n\\nbeginning to crackle and blaze with the red embers. In high glee, the\\n\\ncobblers sat down to their beer and bacon. The door was shut, for there\\n\\nwas nothing but cold moonlight and snow outside; but the hut, strewn\\n\\nwith fir boughs, and ornamented with holly, looked cheerful as the ruddy\\n\\nblaze flared up and rejoiced their hearts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Long life and good fortune to ourselves, brother!\\' said Spare. \\'I hope\\n\\nyou will drink that toast, and may we never have a worse fire on\\n\\nChristmas--but what is that?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Spare set down the drinking-horn, and the brothers listened astonished,\\n\\nfor out of the blazing root they heard, \\'Cuckoo! cuckoo!\\' as plain as\\n\\never the spring-bird\\'s voice came over the moor on a May morning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'It is something bad,\\' said Scrub, terribly frightened.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'May be not,\\' said Spare; and out of the deep hole at the side which\\n\\nthe fire had not reached flew a large gray cuckoo, and lit on the table\\n\\nbefore them. Much as the cobblers had been surprised, they were still\\n\\nmore so when it said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Good gentlemen, what season is this?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'It\\'s Christmas,\\' said Spare.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Then a merry Christmas to you!\\' said the cuckoo. \\'I went to sleep in\\n\\nthe hollow of that old root one evening last summer, and never woke till\\n\\nthe heat of your fire made me think it was summer again; but now since\\n\\nyou have burned my lodging, let me stay in your hut till the spring\\n\\ncomes around--I only want a hole to sleep in, and when I go on my\\n\\ntravels next summer be assured I will bring you some present for your\\n\\ntrouble.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Stay, and welcome,\\' said Spare, while Scrub sat wondering if it were\\n\\nsomething bad or not; \\'I\\'ll make you a good warm hole in the thatch. But\\n\\nyou must be hungry after that long sleep?--here is a slice of barley\\n\\nbread. Come help us to keep Christmas!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The cuckoo ate up the slice, drank water from the brown jug, for he\\n\\nwould take no beer, and flew into a snug hole which Spare scooped for\\n\\nhim in the thatch of the hut.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub said he was afraid it wouldn\\'t be lucky; but as it slept on and\\n\\nthe days passed he forgot his fears. So the snow melted, the heavy rains\\n\\ncame, the cold grew less, the days lengthened, and one sunny morning the\\n\\nbrothers were awakened by the cuckoo shouting its own cry to let them\\n\\nknow the spring had come.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Now I\\'m going on my travels,\\' said the bird, \\'over the world to tell\\n\\nmen of the spring. There is no country where trees bud or flowers bloom,\\n\\nthat I will not cry in before the year goes round. Give me another slice\\n\\nof barley bread to keep me on my journey, and tell me what present I\\n\\nshall bring you at the twelvemonth\\'s end.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub would have been angry with his brother for cutting so large a\\n\\nslice, their store of barley-meal being low; but his mind was occupied\\n\\nwith what present would be most prudent to ask: at length a lucky\\n\\nthought struck him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Good master cuckoo,\\' said he, \\'if a great traveler who sees all the\\n\\nworld like you, could know of any place where diamonds or pearls were to\\n\\nbe found, one of a tolerable size brought in your beak would help such\\n\\npoor men as my brother and I to provide something better than barley\\n\\nbread for your next entertainment.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'I know nothing of diamonds or pearls,\\' said the cuckoo; \\'they are in\\n\\nthe hearts of rocks and the sands of rivers. My knowledge is only of\\n\\nthat which grows on the earth. But there are two trees hard by the well\\n\\nthat lies at the world\\'s end--one of them is called the golden tree, for\\n\\nits leaves are all of beaten gold: every winter they fall into the well\\n\\nwith a sound like scattered coin and I know not what becomes of them. As\\n\\nfor the other, it is always green like a laurel. Some call it the wise,\\n\\nand some the merry tree. Its leaves never fall, but they that get one of\\n\\nthem keep a blithe heart in spite of all misfortunes, and can make\\n\\nthemselves as merry in a hut as in a palace.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Good master cuckoo, bring me a leaf off that tree,\\' cried Spare.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Now, brother, don\\'t be a fool!\\' said Scrub. \\'Think of the leaves of\\n\\nbeaten gold! Dear master cuckoo, bring me one of them!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Before another word could be spoken, the cuckoo had flown out of the\\n\\nopen door, and was shouting its spring cry over moor and meadow. The\\n\\nbrothers were poorer than ever that year; nobody would send them a\\n\\nsingle shoe to mend. The new cobbler said, in scorn, they should come to\\n\\nbe his apprentices; and Scrub and Spare would have left the village but\\n\\nfor their barley field, their cabbage garden, and a certain maid called\\n\\nFairfeather, whom both the cobblers had courted for seven years without\\n\\neven knowing which she meant to favor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sometimes Fairfeather seemed inclined to Scrub, sometimes she smiled on\\n\\nSpare; but the brothers never disputed for that. They sowed their\\n\\nbarley, planted their cabbage, and now that their trade was gone, worked\\n\\nin the rich villagers\\' fields to make out a scanty living. So the\\n\\nseasons came and passed: spring, summer, harvest, and winter followed\\n\\neach other as they have done from the beginning. At the end of the\\n\\nlatter, Scrub and Spare had grown so poor and ragged that Fairfeather\\n\\nthought them beneath her notice. Old neighbors forgot to invite them to\\n\\nwedding feasts or merrymaking; and they thought the cuckoo had forgotten\\n\\nthem too, when at daybreak, on the first of April, they heard a hard\\n\\nbeak knocking at their door, and a voice crying:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Cuckoo! cuckoo! Let me in with my presents.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Spare ran to open the door, and in came the cuckoo, carrying on one\\n\\nside of his bill a golden leaf larger than that of any tree in the north\\n\\ncountry; and in the other, one like that of the common laurel, only it\\n\\nhad a fresher green.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Here,\\' it said, giving the gold to Scrub and the green to Spare, \\'it\\n\\nis a long carriage from the world\\'s end. Give me a slice of barley\\n\\nbread, for I must tell the north country that the spring has come.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub did not grudge the thickness of that slice, though it was cut\\n\\nfrom their last loaf. So much gold had never been in the cobbler\\'s hands\\n\\nbefore, and he could not help exulting over his brother.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'See the wisdom of my choice!\\' he said, holding up the large leaf of\\n\\ngold. \\'As for yours, as good might be plucked from any hedge. I wonder a\\n\\nsensible bird would carry the like so far.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Good master cobbler,\\' cried the cuckoo, finishing the slice, \\'your\\n\\nconclusions are more hasty than courteous. If your brother be\\n\\ndisappointed this time, I go on the same journey every year, and for\\n\\nyour hospitable entertainment will think it no trouble to bring each of\\n\\nyou whichever leaf you desire.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Darling cuckoo!\\' cried Scrub, \\'bring me a golden one;\\' and Spare,\\n\\nlooking up from the green leaf on which he gazed as though it were a\\n\\ncrown-jewel, said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Be sure to bring me one from the merry tree,\\' and away flew the\\n\\ncuckoo.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'This is the Feast of All Fools, and it ought to be your birthday,\\'\\n\\nsaid Scrub. \\'Did ever man fling away such an opportunity of getting\\n\\nrich! Much good your merry leaves will do in the midst of rags and\\n\\npoverty!\\' So he went on, but Spare laughed at him, and answered with\\n\\nquaint old proverbs concerning the cares that come with gold, till\\n\\nScrub, at length getting angry, vowed his brother was not fit to live\\n\\nwith a respectable man; and, taking his lasts, his awls, and his golden\\n\\nleaf, he left the wattle hut, and went to tell the villagers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They were astonished at the folly of Spare and charmed with Scrub\\'s\\n\\ngood sense, particularly when he showed them the golden leaf, and told\\n\\nthat the cuckoo would bring him one every spring. The new cobbler\\n\\nimmediately took him into partnership; the greatest people sent him\\n\\ntheir shoes to mend; Fairfeather smiled graciously upon him, and in the\\n\\ncourse of that summer they were married, with a grand wedding feast, at\\n\\nwhich the whole village danced, except Spare, who was not invited,\\n\\nbecause the bride could not bear his low-mindedness, and his brother\\n\\nthought him a disgrace to the family.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Indeed, all who heard the story concluded that Spare must be mad, and\\n\\nnobody would associate with him but a lame tinker, a beggar-boy, and a\\n\\npoor woman reputed to be a witch because she was old and ugly. As for\\n\\nScrub, he established himself with Fairfeather in a cottage close by\\n\\nthat of the new cobbler, and quite as fine. There he mended shoes to\\n\\neverybody\\'s satisfaction, had a scarlet coat for holidays, and a fat\\n\\ngoose for dinner every wedding-day. Fairfeather, too, had a crimson gown\\n\\nand fine blue ribands; but neither she nor Scrub were content, for to\\n\\nbuy this grandeur the golden leaf had to be broken and parted with piece\\n\\nby piece, so the last morsel was gone before the cuckoo came with\\n\\nanother.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Spare lived on in the old hut, and worked in the cabbage garden. (Scrub\\n\\nhad got the barley field because he was the eldest.) Every day his coat\\n\\ngrew more ragged, and the hut more weatherbeaten; but people remarked\\n\\nthat he never looked sad nor sour; and the wonder was, that from the\\n\\ntime they began to keep his company, the tinker grew kinder to the poor\\n\\nass with which he traveled the country, the beggar-boy kept out of\\n\\nmischief, and the old woman was never cross to her cat or angry with the\\n\\nchildren.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Every first of April the cuckoo came tapping at their doors with the\\n\\ngolden leaf to Scrub and the green to Spare. Fairfeather would have\\n\\nentertained him nobly with wheaten bread and honey, for she had some\\n\\nnotion of persuading him to bring two gold leaves instead of one; but\\n\\nthe cuckoo flew away to eat barley bread with Spare, saying he was not\\n\\nfit company for fine people, and liked the old hut where he slept so\\n\\nsnugly from Christmas till spring.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub spent the golden leaves, and Spare kept the merry ones; and I\\n\\nknow not how many years passed in this manner, when a certain great\\n\\nlord, who owned that village, came to the neighborhood. His castle stood\\n\\non the moor. It was ancient and strong, with high towers and a deep\\n\\nmoat. All the country, as far as one could see from the highest turret,\\n\\nbelonged to its lord; but he had not been there for twenty years, and\\n\\nwould not have come then, only he was melancholy. The cause of his grief\\n\\nwas that he had been prime-minister at court, and in high favor, till\\n\\nsomebody told the crown-prince that he had spoken disrespectfully\\n\\nconcerning the turning out of his royal highness\\'s toes, and the king\\n\\nthat he did not lay on taxes enough, whereon the north country lord was\\n\\nturned out of office, and banished to his own estate. There he lived for\\n\\nsome weeks in very bad temper. The servants said nothing would please\\n\\nhim, and the villagers put on their worst clothes lest he should raise\\n\\ntheir rents; but one day in the harvest time his lordship chanced to\\n\\nmeet Spare gathering water cresses at a meadow stream, and fell into\\n\\ntalk with the cobbler.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How it was nobody could tell, but from the hour of that discourse the\\n\\ngreat lord cast away his melancholy: he forgot his lost office and his\\n\\ncourt enemies, the king\\'s taxes and the crown-prince\\'s toes, and went\\n\\nabout with a noble train hunting, fishing, and making merry in his hall,\\n\\nwhere all travelers were entertained and all the poor were welcome. This\\n\\nstrange story spread through the north country, and great company came\\n\\nto the cobbler\\'s hut--rich men who had lost their money, poor men who\\n\\nhad lost their friends, beauties who had grown old, wits who had gone\\n\\nout of fashion, all came to talk with Spare, and whatever their troubles\\n\\nhad been, all went home merry. The rich gave him presents, the poor gave\\n\\nhim thanks. Spare\\'s coat ceased to be ragged, he had bacon with his\\n\\ncabbage, and the villagers began to think there was some sense in him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"By this time his fame had reached the capital city, and even the court.\\n\\nThere were a great many discontented people there besides the king, who\\n\\nhad lately fallen into ill-humor because a neighboring princess, with\\n\\nseven islands for her dowry, would not marry his eldest son. So a royal\\n\\nmessenger was sent to Spare, with a velvet mantle, a diamond ring, and a\\n\\ncommand that he should repair to court immediately.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'To-morrow is the first of April,\\' said Spare, \\'and I will go with you\\n\\ntwo hours after sunrise.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The messenger lodged all night at the castle, and the cuckoo came at\\n\\nsunrise with the merry leaf.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Court is a fine place,\\' he said when the cobbler told him he was\\n\\ngoing; \\'but I cannot come there, they would lay snares and catch me; so\\n\\nbe careful of the leaves I have brought you, and give me a farewell\\n\\nslice of barley bread.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Spare was sorry to part with the cuckoo, little as he had of his\\n\\ncompany; but he gave him a slice which would have broken Scrub\\'s heart\\n\\nin former times, it was so thick and large; and having sewed up the\\n\\nleaves in the lining of his leather doublet, he set out with the\\n\\nmessenger on his way to court.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"His coming caused great surprise there. Everybody wondered what the\\n\\nking could see in such a common-looking man; but scarce had his majesty\\n\\nconversed with him half an hour, when the princess and her seven islands\\n\\nwere forgotten, and orders given that a feast for all comers should be\\n\\nspread in the banquet hall. The princes of the blood, the great lords\\n\\nand ladies, ministers of state, and judges of the land, after that\\n\\ndiscoursed with Spare, and the more they talked the lighter grew their\\n\\nhearts, so that such changes had never been seen at court. The lords\\n\\nforgot their spites and the ladies their envies, the princes and\\n\\nministers made friends among themselves, and the judges showed no favor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"As for Spare, he had a Chamber assigned him in the palace, and a seat\\n\\nat the king\\'s table; one sent him rich robes and another costly jewels;\\n\\nbut in the midst of all his grandeur he still wore the leathern doublet,\\n\\nwhich the palace servants thought remarkably mean. One day the king\\'s\\n\\nattention being drawn to it by the chief page, his majesty inquired why\\n\\nSpare didn\\'t give it to a beggar. But the cobbler answered:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'High and mighty monarch, this doublet was with me before silk and\\n\\nvelvet came--I find it easier to wear than the court cut; moreover, it\\n\\nserves to keep me humble, by recalling the days when it was my holiday\\n\\ngarment.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The king thought this a wise speech, and commanded that no one should\\n\\nfind fault with the leathern doublet. So things went, till tidings of\\n\\nhis brother\\'s good fortune reached Scrub in the moorland cottage on\\n\\nanother first of April, when the cuckoo came with two golden leaves,\\n\\nbecause he had none to carry for Spare.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Think of that!\\' said Fairfeather. \\'Here we are spending our lives in\\n\\nthis humdrum place, and Spare making his fortune at court with two or\\n\\nthree paltry green leaves! What would they say to our golden ones? Let\\n\\nus pack up and make our way to the king\\'s palace; I\\'m sure he will make\\n\\nyou a lord and me a lady of honor, not to speak of all the fine clothes\\n\\nand presents we shall have.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub thought this excellent reasoning, and their packing up began: but\\n\\nit was soon found that the cottage contained few things fit for carrying\\n\\nto court. Fairfeather could not think of her wooden bowls, spoons, and\\n\\ntrenchers being seen there. Scrub considered his lasts and awls better\\n\\nleft behind, as without them, he concluded, no one would suspect him of\\n\\nbeing a cobbler. So putting on their holiday clothes, Fairfeather took\\n\\nher looking-glass and Scrub his drinking horn, which happened to have a\\n\\nvery thin rim of silver, and each carrying a golden leaf carefully\\n\\nwrapped up that none might see it till they reached the palace, the pair\\n\\nset out in great expectation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How far Scrub and Fairfeather journeyed I cannot say, but when the sun\\n\\nwas high and warm at noon, they came into a wood both tired and hungry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'If I had known it was so far to court,\\' said Scrub, \\'I would have\\n\\nbrought the end of that barley loaf which we left in the cupboard.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Husband,\\' said Fairfeather, \\'you shouldn\\'t have such mean thoughts:\\n\\nhow could one eat barley bread on the way to a palace? Let us rest\\n\\nourselves under this tree, and look at our golden leaves to see if they\\n\\nare safe.\\' In looking at the leaves, and talking of their fine\\n\\nprospects, Scrub and Fairfeather did not perceive that a very thin old\\n\\nwoman had slipped from behind the tree, with a long staff in her hand\\n\\nand a great wallet by her side.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Noble lord and lady,\\' she said, \\'for I know ye are such by your\\n\\nvoices, though my eyes are dim and my hearing none of the sharpest, will\\n\\nye condescend to tell me where I may find some water to mix a bottle of\\n\\nmead which I carry in my wallet, because it is too strong for me?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"As the old woman spoke, she pulled out a large wooden bottle such as\\n\\nshepherds used in the ancient times, corked with leaves rolled together,\\n\\nand having a small wooden cup hanging from its handle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Perhaps ye will do me the favor to taste,\\' she said. \\'It is only made\\n\\nof the best honey. I have also cream cheese, and a wheaten loaf here, if\\n\\nsuch honorable persons as you would eat the like.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub and Fairfeather became very condescending after this speech. They\\n\\nwere now sure that there must be some appearance of nobility about them;\\n\\nbesides, they were very hungry, and having hastily wrapped up the golden\\n\\nleaves, they assured the old woman they were not at all proud,\\n\\nnotwithstanding the lands and castles they had left behind them in the\\n\\nnorth country, and would willingly help to lighten the wallet. The old\\n\\nwoman could scarcely be persuaded to sit down for pure humility, but at\\n\\nlength she did, and before the wallet was half empty, Scrub and\\n\\nFairfeather firmly believed that there must be something remarkably\\n\\nnoble-looking about them. This was not entirely owing to her ingenious\\n\\ndiscourse. The old woman was a wood-witch; her name was Buttertongue;\\n\\nand all her time was spent in making mead, which, being boiled with\\n\\ncurious herbs and spells, had the power of making all who drank it fall\\n\\nasleep and dream with their eyes open. She had two dwarfs of sons; one\\n\\nwas named Spy, and the other Pounce. Wherever their mother went they\\n\\nwere not far behind; and whoever tasted her mead was sure to be robbed\\n\\nby the dwarfs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub and Fairfeather sat leaning against the old tree. The cobbler had\\n\\na lump of cheese in his hand; his wife held fast a hunk of bread. Their\\n\\neyes and mouths were both open, but they were dreaming of great grandeur\\n\\nat court, when the old woman raised her shrill voice--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'What ho, my sons! come here and carry home the harvest.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No sooner had she spoken, than the two little dwarfs darted out of the\\n\\nneighboring thicket.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Idle boys!\\' cried the mother, \\'what have ye done to-day to help our\\n\\nliving?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'I have been to the city,\\' said Spy, \\'and could see nothing. These are\\n\\nhard times for us--everybody minds their business so contentedly since\\n\\nthat cobbler came; but here is a leathern doublet which his page threw\\n\\nout of the window; it\\'s of no use, but I brought it to let you see I was\\n\\nnot idle.\\' And he tossed down Spare\\'s doublet, with the merry leaves in\\n\\nit, which he had carried like a bundle on his little back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"To explain how Spy came by it, I must tell you that the forest was not\\n\\nfar from the great city where Spare lived in such esteem. All things had\\n\\ngone well with the cobbler till the king thought that it was quite\\n\\nunbecoming to see such a worthy man without a servant. His majesty,\\n\\ntherefore, to let all men understand his royal favor toward Spare,\\n\\nappointed one of his own pages to wait upon him. The name of this youth\\n\\nwas Tinseltoes, and, though he was the seventh of the king\\'s pages,\\n\\nnobody in all the court had grander notions. Nothing could please him\\n\\nthat had not gold or silver about it, and his grandmother feared he\\n\\nwould hang himself for being appointed page to a cobbler. As for Spare,\\n\\nif anything could have troubled him, this token of his majesty\\'s\\n\\nkindness would have done it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The honest man had been so used to serve himself that the page was\\n\\nalways in the way, but his merry leaves came to his assistance; and, to\\n\\nthe great surprise of his grandmother, Tinseltoes took wonderfully to\\n\\nthe new service. Some said it was because Spare gave him nothing to do\\n\\nbut play at bowls all day on the palace-green. Yet one thing grieved the\\n\\nheart of Tinseltoes, and that was his master\\'s leathern doublet, but for\\n\\nit he was persuaded people would never remember that Spare had been a\\n\\ncobbler, and the page took a great deal of pains to let him see how\\n\\nunfashionable it was at court; but Spare answered Tinseltoes as he had\\n\\ndone the king, and at last, finding nothing better would do, the page\\n\\ngot up one fine morning earlier than his master, and tossed the leathern\\n\\ndoublet out of the back window into a certain lane where Spy found it,\\n\\nand brought it to his mother.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'That nasty thing!\\' said the old woman; \\'where is the good in it?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"By this time, Pounce had taken everything of value from Scrub and\\n\\nFairfeather--the looking-glass, the silver-rimmed horn, the husband\\'s\\n\\nscarlet coat, the wife\\'s gay mantle, and, above all, the golden leaves,\\n\\nwhich so rejoiced old Buttertongue and her sons, that they threw the\\n\\nleathern doublet over the sleeping cobbler for a jest, and went off to\\n\\ntheir hut in the heart of the forest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The sun was going down when Scrub and Fairfeather awoke from dreaming\\n\\nthat they had been made a lord and a lady, and sat clothed in silk and\\n\\nvelvet, feasting with the king in his palace-hall. It was a great\\n\\ndisappointment to find their golden leaves and all their best things\\n\\ngone. Scrub tore his hair, and vowed to take the old woman\\'s life, while\\n\\nFairfeather lamented sore; but Scrub, feeling cold for want of his coat,\\n\\nput on the leathern doublet without asking or caring whence it came.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scarcely was it buttoned on when a change came over him; he addressed\\n\\nsuch merry discourse to Fairfeather, that, instead of lamentations, she\\n\\nmade the wood ring with laughter. Both busied themselves in getting up a\\n\\nhut of boughs, in which Scrub kindled a fire with a flint and steel,\\n\\nwhich, together with his pipe, he had brought unknown to Fairfeather,\\n\\nwho had told him the like was never heard of at court. Then they found a\\n\\npheasant\\'s nest at the root of an old oak, made a meal of roasted eggs,\\n\\nand went to sleep on a heap of long green grass which they had gathered,\\n\\nwith nightingales singing all night long in the old trees about them. So\\n\\nit happened that Scrub and Fairfeather stayed day after day in the\\n\\nforest, making their hut larger and more comfortable against the winter,\\n\\nliving on wild birds\\' eggs and berries, and never thinking of their lost\\n\\ngolden leaves, or their journey to court.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"In the meantime Spare had got up and missed his doublet. Tinseltoes, of\\n\\ncourse, said he knew nothing about it. The whole palace was searched,\\n\\nand every servant questioned, till all the court wondered why such a\\n\\nfuss was made about an old leathern doublet. That very day things came\\n\\nback to their old fashion. Quarrels began among the lords, and\\n\\njealousies among the ladies. The king said his subjects did not pay him\\n\\nhalf enough taxes, the queen wanted more jewels, the servants took to\\n\\ntheir old bickerings and got up some new ones. Spare found himself\\n\\ngetting wonderfully dull, and very much out of place: nobles began to\\n\\nask what business a cobbler had at the king\\'s table, and his majesty\\n\\nordered the palace chronicles to be searched for a precedent. The\\n\\ncobbler was too wise to tell all he had lost with that doublet, but\\n\\nbeing by this time somewhat familiar with court customs, he proclaimed a\\n\\nreward of fifty gold pieces to any who would bring him news concerning\\n\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scarcely was this made known in the city, when the gates and outer\\n\\ncourts of the palace were filled by men, women, and children, some\\n\\nbringing leathern doublets of every cut and color; some with tales of\\n\\nwhat they had heard and seen in their walks about the neighborhood; and\\n\\nso much news concerning all sorts of great people came out of these\\n\\nstories, that lords and ladies ran to the king with complaints of Spare\\n\\nas a speaker of slander; and his majesty, being now satisfied that there\\n\\nwas no example in all the palace records of such a retainer, issued a\\n\\ndecree banishing the cobbler for ever from court, and confiscating all\\n\\nhis goods in favor of Tinseltoes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That royal edict was scarcely published before the page was in full\\n\\npossession of his rich chamber, his costly garments, and all the\\n\\npresents the courtiers had given him; while Spare, having no longer the\\n\\nfifty pieces of gold to give, was glad to make his escape out of the\\n\\nback window, for fear of the nobles, who vowed to be revenged on him,\\n\\nand the crowd, who were prepared to stone him for cheating them about\\n\\nhis doublet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The window from which Spare let himself down with a strong rope, was\\n\\nthat from which Tinseltoes had tossed the doublet, and as the cobbler\\n\\ncame down late in the twilight, a poor woodman, with a heavy load of\\n\\nfagots, stopped and stared at him in great astonishment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'What\\'s the matter, friend?\\' said Spare. \\'Did you never see a man\\n\\ncoming down from a back window before?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Why,\\' said the woodman, \\'the last morning I passed here a leathern\\n\\ndoublet came out of that very window, and I\\'ll be bound you are the\\n\\nowner of it.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'That I am, friend,\\' said the cobbler. \\'Can you tell me which way that\\n\\ndoublet went?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'As I walked on,\\' said the woodman, \\'a dwarf, called Spy, bundled it up\\n\\nand ran off to his mother in the forest.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Honest friend,\\' said Spare, taking off the last of his fine clothes (a\\n\\ngrass-green mantle edged with gold), I\\'ll give you this if you will\\n\\nfollow the dwarf, and bring me back my doublet.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'It would not be good to carry fagots in,\\' said the woodman. \\'But if\\n\\nyou want back your doublet, the road to the forest lies at the end of\\n\\nthis lane,\\' and he trudged away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Determined to find his doublet, and sure that neither crowd nor\\n\\ncourtiers could catch him in the forest, Spare went on his way, and was\\n\\nsoon among the tall trees; but neither hut nor dwarf could he see.\\n\\nMoreover, the night came on; the wood was dark and tangled, but here and\\n\\nthere the moon shone through its alleys, the great owls flitted about,\\n\\nand the nightingales sang. So he went on, hoping to find some place of\\n\\nshelter. At last the red light of a fire, gleaming through a thicket,\\n\\nled him to the door of a low hut. It stood half open, as if there was\\n\\nnothing to fear, and within he saw his brother Scrub snoring loudly on a\\n\\nbed of grass, at the foot of which lay his own leathern doublet; while\\n\\nFairfeather, in a kirtle made of plaited rushes, sat roasting pheasants\\'\\n\\neggs by the fire.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Good evening, mistress,\\' said Spare, stepping in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The blaze shone on him, but so changed was her brother-in-law with his\\n\\ncourt-life, that Fairfeather did not know him, and she answered far\\n\\nmore courteously than was her wont.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Good evening, master. Whence come ye so late? but speak low, for my\\n\\ngood man has sorely tired himself cleaving wood, and is taking a sleep,\\n\\nas you see, before supper!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'A good rest to him,\\' said Spare, perceiving he was not known. \\'I come\\n\\nfrom the court for a day\\'s hunting, and have lost my way in the forest.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Sit down and have a share of our supper,\\' said Fairfeather, \\'I will\\n\\nput some more eggs in the ashes; and tell me the news of court--I used\\n\\nto think of it long ago when I was young and foolish.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Did you never go there?\\' said the cobbler. \\'So fair a dame as you\\n\\nwould make the ladies marvel.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'You are pleased to flatter,\\' said Fairfeather; \\'but my husband has a\\n\\nbrother there, and we left our moorland village to try our fortune also.\\n\\nAn old woman enticed us with fair words and strong drink at the entrance\\n\\nof this forest, where we fell asleep and dreamt of great things; but\\n\\nwhen we woke, everything had been robbed from us--my looking-glass, my\\n\\nscarlet cloak, my husband\\'s Sunday coat; and, in place of all, the\\n\\nrobbers left him that old leathern doublet, which he has worn ever\\n\\nsince, and never was so merry in all his life, though we live in this\\n\\npoor hut.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'It is a shabby doublet, that,\\' said Spare, taking up the garment, and\\n\\nseeing that it was his own, for the merry leaves were still sewed in its\\n\\nlining. \\'It would be good for hunting in, however--your husband would be\\n\\nglad to part with it, I dare say, in exchange for this handsome cloak;\\'\\n\\nand he pulled off the green mantle and buttoned on the doublet, much to\\n\\nFairfeather\\'s delight, who ran and shook Scrub, crying--\"\\'Husband!\\n\\nhusband! rise and see what a good bargain I have made.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub gave one closing snore, and muttered something about the root\\n\\nbeing hard; but he rubbed his eyes, gazed up at his brother, and said--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Spare, is that really you? How did you like the court, and have you\\n\\nmade your fortune?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'That I have, brother,\\' said Spare, \\'in getting back my own good\\n\\nleathern doublet. Come, let us eat eggs, and rest ourselves here this\\n\\nnight. In the morning we will return to our own old hut, at the end of\\n\\nthe moorland village where the Christmas Cuckoo will come and bring us\\n\\nleaves.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub and Fairfeather agreed. So in the morning they all returned, and\\n\\nfound the old hut little the worse for wear and weather. The neighbors\\n\\ncame about them to ask the news of court, and see if they had made their\\n\\nfortune. Everybody was astonished to find the three poorer than ever,\\n\\nbut somehow they liked to go back to the hut. Spare brought out the\\n\\nlasts and awls he had hidden in a corner; Scrub and he began their old\\n\\ntrade, and the whole north country found out that there never were such\\n\\ncobblers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They mended the shoes of lords and ladies as well as the common people;\\n\\neverybody was satisfied. Their custom increased from day to day, and all\\n\\nthat were disappointed, discontented, or unlucky, came to the hut as in\\n\\nold times, before Spare went to court.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The rich brought them presents, the poor did them service. The hut\\n\\nitself changed, no one knew how. Flowering honeysuckle grew over its\\n\\nroof; red and white roses grew thick about its door. Moreover, the\\n\\nChristmas Cuckoo always came on the first of April, bringing three\\n\\nleaves of the merry tree--for Scrub and Fairfeather would have no more\\n\\ngolden ones. So it was with them when I last heard the news of the north\\n\\ncountry.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: THE EMPEROR\\'S VISION]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 11: By permission from _Granny\\'s Wonderful Chair_, by Frances\\n\\nBrowne.

Dutton & Company.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE EMPEROR\\'S VISION[12]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIT happened at the time when Augustus was Emperor in Rome and Herod was\\n\\nKing in Jerusalem.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was then that a very great and holy night sank down over the earth.\\n\\nIt was the darkest night that any one had ever seen. One could have\\n\\nbelieved that the whole earth had fallen into a cellar-vault. It was\\n\\nimpossible to distinguish water from land, and one could not find one\\'s\\n\\nway on the most familiar road. And it couldn\\'t be otherwise, for not a\\n\\nray of light came from heaven. All the stars stayed at home in their own\\n\\nhouses, and the fair moon held her face averted.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe silence and the stillness were as profound as the darkness. The\\n\\nrivers stood still in their courses, the wind did not stir, and even the\\n\\naspen leaves had ceased to quiver. Had any one walked along the\\n\\nsea-shore, he would have found that the waves no longer dashed upon the\\n\\nsands; and had one wandered in the desert, the sand would not have\\n\\ncrunched under one\\'s feet. Everything was as motionless as if turned to\\n\\nstone, so as not to disturb the holy night. The grass was afraid to\\n\\ngrow, the dew could not fall, and the flowers dared not exhale their\\n\\nperfume.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn this night the wild beasts did not seek their prey, the serpents did\\n\\nnot sting, and the dogs did not bark. And what was even more glorious,\\n\\ninanimate things would have been unwilling to disturb the night\\'s\\n\\nsanctity, by lending themselves to an evil deed. No false key could have\\n\\npicked a lock, and no knife could possibly have drawn a drop of blood.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Rome, during this very night, a small company of people came from the\\n\\nEmperor\\'s palace at the Palatine and took the path across the Forum\\n\\nwhich led to the Capitol. During the day just ended the Senators had\\n\\nasked the Emperor if he had any objections to their erecting a temple to\\n\\nhim on Rome\\'s sacred hill. But Augustus had not immediately given his\\n\\nconsent. He did not know if it would be agreeable to the gods that he\\n\\nshould own a temple next to theirs, and he had replied that first he\\n\\nwished to ascertain their will in the matter by offering a nocturnal\\n\\nsacrifice to his genius. It was he who, accompanied by a few trusted\\n\\nfriends, was on his way to perform this sacrifice.\\n\\n\\n\\nAugustus let them carry him in his litter, for he was old, and it was an\\n\\neffort for him to climb the long stairs leading to the Capitol. He\\n\\nhimself held the cage with the doves for the sacrifice. No priests or\\n\\nsoldiers or senators accompanied him, only his nearest friends.\\n\\nTorch-bearers walked in front of him in order to light the way in the\\n\\nnight darkness and behind him followed the slaves, who carried the\\n\\ntripod, the knives, the charcoal, the sacred fire, and all the other\\n\\nthings needed for the sacrifice.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the way the Emperor chatted gayly with his faithful followers, and\\n\\ntherefore none of them noticed the infinite silence and stillness of the\\n\\nnight. Only when they had reached the highest point of the Capitol Hill\\n\\nand the vacant spot upon which they contemplated erecting the temple,\\n\\ndid it dawn upon them that something unusual was taking place.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt could not be a night like all others, for up on the very edge of the\\n\\ncliff they saw the most remarkable being! At first they thought it was\\n\\nan old, distorted olive-trunk; later they imagined that an ancient stone\\n\\nfigure from the temple of Jupiter had wandered out on the cliff. Finally\\n\\nit was apparent to them that it could be only the old sibyl.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnything so aged, so weather-beaten, and so giantlike in stature they\\n\\nhad never seen. This old woman was awe-inspiring! If the Emperor had not\\n\\nbeen present, they would all have fled to their homes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is she,\" they whispered to each other, \"who has lived as many years\\n\\nas there are sand-grains on her native shores. Why has she come out from\\n\\nher cave just to-night? What does she foretell for the Emperor and the\\n\\nEmpire--she, who writes her prophecies on the leaves of the trees and\\n\\nknows that the wind will carry the words of the oracle to the person for\\n\\nwhom they are intended?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThey were so terrified that they would have dropped on their knees with\\n\\ntheir foreheads pressed against the earth, had the sibyl stirred. But\\n\\nshe sat as still as though she were lifeless. Crouching upon the\\n\\noutermost edge of the cliff, and shading her eyes with her hand, she\\n\\npeered out into the night. She sat there as if she had gone up on the\\n\\nhill that she might see more clearly something that was happening far\\n\\naway. _She_ could see things on a night like this!\\n\\n\\n\\nAt that moment the Emperor and all his retinue, marked how profound the\\n\\ndarkness was. None of them could see a hand\\'s breadth in front of him.\\n\\nAnd what stillness! What silence! Not even the Tiber\\'s hollow murmur\\n\\ncould they hear. The air seemed to suffocate them, cold sweat broke out\\n\\non their foreheads, and their hands were numb and powerless. They feared\\n\\nthat some dreadful disaster was impending.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut no one cared to show that he was afraid, and every one told the\\n\\nEmperor that this was a good omen. All Nature held its breath to greet a\\n\\nnew god.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey counseled Augustus to hurry with the sacrifice, and said that the\\n\\nold sibyl had evidently come out of her cave to greet his genius.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the truth was that the old sibyl was so absorbed in a vision that\\n\\nshe did not even know that Augustus had come up to the Capitol. She was\\n\\ntransported in spirit to a far-distant land, where she imagined that she\\n\\nwas wandering over a great plain. In the darkness she stubbed her foot\\n\\ncontinually against something, which she believed to be grass-tufts. She\\n\\nstooped down and felt with her hand. No, it was not grass, but sheep.\\n\\nShe was walking between great sleeping flocks of sheep.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen she noticed the shepherds\\' fire. It burned in the middle of the\\n\\nfield, and she groped her way to it. The shepherds lay asleep by the\\n\\nfire, and beside them were the long, spiked staves with which they\\n\\ndefended their flocks from wild beasts. But the little animals with the\\n\\nglittering eyes and the bushy tails that stole up to the fire, were they\\n\\nnot jackals? And yet the shepherds did not fling their staves at them,\\n\\nthe dogs continued to sleep, the sheep did not flee, and the wild\\n\\nanimals lay down to rest beside the human beings.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis the sibyl saw, but she knew nothing of what was being enacted on\\n\\nthe hill back of her. She did not know that there they were raising an\\n\\naltar, lighting charcoal and strewing incense, and that the Emperor took\\n\\none of the doves from the cage to sacrifice it. But his hands were so\\n\\nbenumbed that he could not hold the bird. With one stroke of the wing,\\n\\nit freed itself and disappeared in the night darkness.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen this happened, the courtiers glanced suspiciously at the old sibyl.\\n\\nThey believed that it was she who caused the misfortune.\\n\\n\\n\\nCould they know that all the while the sibyl thought herself standing\\n\\nbeside the shepherds\\' fire, and that she listened to a faint sound which\\n\\ncame trembling through the dead-still night? She heard it long before\\n\\nshe marked that it did not come from earth, but from the sky. At last\\n\\nshe raised her head; then she saw light, shimmering forms glide forward\\n\\nin the darkness. They were little flocks of angels, who, singing\\n\\njoyously, and apparently searching, flew back and forth above the wide\\n\\nplain.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile the sibyl was listening to the angel-song, the Emperor was making\\n\\npreparations for a new sacrifice. He washed his hands, cleansed the\\n\\naltar, and took up the other dove. And, although he exerted his full\\n\\nstrength to hold it fast, the dove\\'s slippery body slid from his hand,\\n\\nand the bird swung itself up into the impenetrable night.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Emperor was appalled! He fell upon his knees and prayed to his\\n\\ngenius. He implored him for strength to avert the disasters which this\\n\\nnight seemed to foreshadow.\\n\\n\\n\\nNor did the sibyl hear any of this either. She was listening with her\\n\\nwhole soul to the angel-song, which grew louder and louder. At last it\\n\\nbecame so powerful that it wakened the shepherds. They raised themselves\\n\\non their elbows and saw shining hosts of silver-white angels move in\\n\\nthe darkness in long swaying lines, like migratory birds. Some held\\n\\nlutes and cymbals in their hands; others held zithers and harps, and\\n\\ntheir song rang out as merry as child-laughter, and as carefree as the\\n\\nlark\\'s thrill. When the shepherds heard this, they rose up to go to the\\n\\nmountain city, where they lived, to tell of the miracle.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey groped their way forward on a narrow, winding path, and the sibyl\\n\\nfollowed them. Suddenly it grew light up there on the mountain: a big,\\n\\nclear star kindled right over it, and the city on the mountain summit\\n\\nglittered like silver in the starlight. All the fluttering angel throngs\\n\\nhastened thither, shouting for joy, and the shepherds hurried so that\\n\\nthey almost ran. When they reached the city, they found that the angels\\n\\nhad assembled over a low stable near the city gate. It was a wretched\\n\\nstructure, with a roof of straw and the naked cliff for a back wall.\\n\\nOver it hung the Star, and hither flocked more and more angels. Some\\n\\nseated themselves on the straw roof or alighted upon the steep\\n\\nmountain-wall back of the house; others, again, held themselves in the\\n\\nair on outspread wings, and hovered over it. High, high up, the air was\\n\\nilluminated by the shining wings.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe instant the Star kindled over the mountain city, all Nature awoke,\\n\\nand the men who stood upon Capitol Hill could not help seeing it. They\\n\\nfelt fresh, but caressing winds which traveled through space; delicious\\n\\nperfumes streamed up about them; trees swayed; the Tiber began to\\n\\nmurmur; the stars twinkled, and suddenly the moon stood out in the sky\\n\\nand lit up the world. And out of the clouds the two doves came circling\\n\\ndown and lighted upon the Emperor\\'s shoulders.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen this miracle happened, Augustus rose, proud and happy, but his\\n\\nfriends and his slaves fell on their knees.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hail, Csar!\" they cried. \"Thy genius hath answered thee. Thou art the\\n\\ngod who shall be worshiped on Capitol Hill!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd this cry of homage, which the men in their transport gave as a\\n\\ntribute to the emperor, was so loud that the old sibyl heard it. It\\n\\nwaked her from her visions. She rose from her place on the edge of the\\n\\ncliff, and came down among the people. It was as if a dark cloud had\\n\\narisen from the abyss and rushed down the mountain height. She was\\n\\nterrifying in her extreme age! Coarse hair hung in matted tangles around\\n\\nher head, her joints were enlarged, and the dark skin, hard as the bark\\n\\nof a tree, covered her body with furrow upon furrow.\\n\\n\\n\\nPotent and awe-inspiring, she advanced toward the Emperor. With one hand\\n\\nshe clutched his wrist, with the other she pointed toward the distant\\n\\nEast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Look!\" she commanded, and the Emperor raised his eyes and saw. The\\n\\nvaulted heavens opened before his eyes, and his glance traveled to the\\n\\ndistant Orient. He saw a lowly stable behind a steep rock wall, and in\\n\\nthe open doorway a few shepherds kneeling. Within the stable he saw a\\n\\nyoung mother on her knees before a little child, who lay upon a bundle\\n\\nof straw on the floor.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the sibyl\\'s big, knotty fingers pointed toward the poor babe. \"Hail,\\n\\nCsar!\" cried the sibyl, in a burst of scornful laughter. \"There is the\\n\\ngod who shall be worshiped on Capitol Hill!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen Augustus shrank back from her, as from a maniac. But upon the sibyl\\n\\nfell the mighty spirit of prophecy. Her dim eyes began to burn, her\\n\\nhands were stretched toward heaven, her voice was so changed that it\\n\\nseemed not to be her own, but rang out with such resonance and power\\n\\nthat it could have been heard over the whole world. And she uttered\\n\\nwords which she appeared to be reading among the stars.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Upon Capitol Hill shall the Redeemer of the world be\\n\\nworshiped--_Christ_--but not frail mortals.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen she had said this, she strode past the terror-stricken men, walked\\n\\nslowly down the mountain, and disappeared.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, on the following day, Augustus strictly forbade the people to raise\\n\\nany temple to him on Capitol Hill. In place of it he built a sanctuary\\n\\nto the new-born GodChild, and called it HEAVEN\\'S ALTAR--_Ara Coeli_.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: THE VOYAGE OF THE WEE RED CAP]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 12: By permission from _Christ Legends,_ by Selma Lagerlof.\\n\\nCopyright by Henry Holt & Company.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE VOYAGE OF THE WEE RED CAP[13]\\n\\n\\n\\nIT was the Eve of St. Stephen, and Teig sat alone by his fire with\\n\\nnaught in his cupboard but a pinch of tea and a bare mixing of meal, and\\n\\na heart inside of him as soft and warm as the ice on the water bucket\\n\\noutside the door. The tuft was near burnt on the hearth--a handful of\\n\\ngolden cinders left, just; and Teig took to counting them greedily on\\n\\nhis fingers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s one, two, three, an\\' four an\\' five,\" he laughed. \"Faith, there\\n\\nbe more bits o\\' real gold hid undther the loose clay in the corner.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was the truth; and it was the scraping and scrooching for the last\\n\\npiece that had left Teig\\'s cupboard bare of a Christmas dinner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Gold is betther nor eatin\\' an\\' dthrinkin\\'. An\\' if ye have naught to\\n\\ngive, there\\'ll be naught asked of ye;\" and he laughed again.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was thinking of the neighbors, and the doles of food and piggins of\\n\\nmilk that would pass over their thresholds that night to the vagabonds\\n\\nand paupers who were sure to come begging. And on the heels of that\\n\\nthought followed another: who would be giving old Barney his dinner?\\n\\nBarney lived a stone\\'s throw from Teig, alone, in a wee tumbled-in\\n\\ncabin; and for a score of years past Teig had stood on the doorstep\\n\\nevery Christmas Eve, and, making a hollow of his two hands, had called\\n\\nacross the road:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hey, there, Barney, will ye come over for a sup?\" And Barney had\\n\\nreached for his crutches--there being but one leg to him--and had come.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Faith,\" said Teig, trying another laugh, \"Barney can fast for the once;\\n\\n\\'twill be all the same in a month\\'s time.\" And he fell to thinking of\\n\\nthe gold again.\\n\\n\\n\\nA knock came at the door. Teig pulled himself down in his chair where\\n\\nthe shadow would cover him, and held his tongue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Teig, Teig!\" It was the widow O\\'Donnelly\\'s voice. \"If ye are there,\\n\\nopen your door. I have not got the pay for the spriggin\\' this month, an\\'\\n\\nthe childher are needin\\' food.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Teig put the leash on his tongue, and never stirred till he heard\\n\\nthe tramp of her feet going on to the next cabin. Then he saw to it that\\n\\nthe door was tight-barred. Another knock came, and it was a stranger\\'s\\n\\nvoice this time:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The other cabins are filled; not one but has its hearth crowded; will\\n\\nye take us in--the two of us? The wind bites mortal sharp, not a morsel\\n\\no\\' food have we tasted this day. Masther, will ye take us in?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Teig sat on, a-holding his tongue; and the tramp of the strangers\\'\\n\\nfeet passed down the road. Others took their place--small feet, running.\\n\\nIt was the miller\\'s wee Cassie, and she called out as she ran by:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Old Barney\\'s watchin\\' for ye. Ye\\'ll not be forget-tin\\' him, will ye,\\n\\nTeig?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then the child broke into a song, sweet and clear, as she passed\\n\\ndown the road:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Listen all ye, \\'tis the Feast o\\' St. Stephen,\\n\\n    Mind that ye keep it, this holy even.\\n\\n    Open your door an\\' greet ye the stranger--\\n\\n    For ye mind that the wee Lord had naught but a manger.\\n\\n                                      Mhuire as traugh!\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Feed ye the hungry an\\' rest ye the weary,\\n\\n    This ye must do for the sake of Our Mary.\\n\\n    \\'Tis well that ye mind--ye who sit by the fire--\\n\\n    That the Lord he was born in a dark and cold byre.\\n\\n                                  Mhuire as traugh!\\n\\n\\n\\nTeig put his fingers deep in his ears. \"A million murdthering curses on\\n\\nthem that won\\'t let me be! Can\\'t a man try to keep what is his without\\n\\nbein\\' pesthered by them that has only idled an\\' wasted their days?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then a strange thing happened: hundreds and hundreds of wee lights\\n\\nbegan dancing outside the window, making the room bright; the hands of\\n\\nthe clock began chasing each other round the dial, and the bolt of the\\n\\ndoor drew itself out. Slowly, without a creak or a cringe, the door\\n\\nopened, and in there trooped a crowd of the Good People. Their wee green\\n\\ncloaks were folded close about them, and each carried a rush candle.\\n\\n\\n\\nTeig was filled with a great wonderment, entirely, when he saw the\\n\\nfairies, but when they saw him they laughed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We are takin\\' the loan o\\' your cabin this night, Teig,\" said they. \"Ye\\n\\nare the only man hereabout with an empty hearth, an\\' we\\'re needin\\' one.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWithout saying more, they bustled about the room making ready. They\\n\\nlengthened out the table and spread and set it; more of the Good People\\n\\ntrooped in, bringing stools and food and drink. The pipers came last,\\n\\nand they sat themselves around the chimney-piece a-blowing their\\n\\nchanters and trying the drones. The feasting began and the pipers played\\n\\nand never had Teig seen such a sight in his life. Suddenly a wee man\\n\\nsang out:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Clip, clap, clip, clap, I wish I had my wee red cap!\" And out of the\\n\\nair there tumbled the neatest cap Teig ever laid his two eyes on. The\\n\\nwee man clapped it on his head, crying:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wish I was in Spain!\" and--whist--up the chimney he went, and away\\n\\nout of sight.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt happened just as I am telling it. Another wee man called for his cap,\\n\\nand away he went after the first. And then another and another until the\\n\\nroom was empty and Teig sat alone again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"By my soul,\" said Teig, \"I\\'d like to thravel that way myself! It\\'s a\\n\\ngrand savin\\' of tickets an\\' baggage; an\\' ye get to a place before ye\\'ve\\n\\nhad time to change your mind. Faith there is no harm done if I thry it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo he sang the fairies\\' rime and out of the air dropped a wee cap for\\n\\nhim. For a moment the wonder had him, but the next he was clapping the\\n\\ncap on his head and crying:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Spain!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen--whist--up the chimney he went after the fairies, and before he had\\n\\ntime to let out his breath he was standing in the middle of Spain, and\\n\\nstrangeness all about him.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was in a great city. The doorways of the houses were hung with\\n\\nflowers and the air was warm and sweet with the smell of them. Torches\\n\\nburned along the streets, sweetmeat-sellers went about crying their\\n\\nwares, and on the steps of the cathedral crouched a crowd of beggars.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the meanin\\' o\\' that?\" asked Teig of one of the fairies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They are waiting for those that are hearing mass. When they come out,\\n\\nthey give half of what they have to those that have nothing, so on this\\n\\nnight of all the year there shall be no hunger and no cold.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then far down the street came the sound of a child\\'s voice, singing:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Listen all ye, \\'tis the Feast o\\' St. Stephen,\\n\\n    Mind that ye keep it, this holy even.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Curse it!\" said Teig; \"can a song fly afther ye?\" And then he heard the\\n\\nfairies cry \"Holland!\" and he cried \"Holland!\" too.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn one leap he was over France, and another over Belgium; and with the\\n\\nthird he was standing by long ditches of water frozen fast, and over\\n\\nthem glided hundreds upon hundreds of lads and maids. Outside each door\\n\\nstood a wee wooden shoe empty. Teig saw scores of them as he looked down\\n\\nthe ditch of a street.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What is the meanin\\' o\\' those shoes?\" he asked the fairies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ye poor lad!\" answered the wee man next to him; \"are ye not knowing\\n\\nanything? This is the Gift Night of the year, when every man gives to\\n\\nhis neighbor.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nA child came to the window of one of the houses, and in her hand was a\\n\\nlighted candle. She was singing as she put the light down close to the\\n\\nglass, and Teig caught the words:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Open your door an\\' greet ye the stranger--\\n\\n    For ye mind that the wee Lord had naught but a manger.\\n\\n                                    Mhuire as traugh!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Tis the de\\'il\\'s work!\" cried Teig, and he set the red cap more firmly\\n\\non his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m for another country.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI cannot be telling you half the adventures Teig had that night, nor\\n\\nhalf the sights that he saw. But he passed by fields that held sheaves\\n\\nof grain for the birds and doorsteps that held bowls of porridge for the\\n\\nwee creatures. He saw lighted trees, sparkling and heavy with gifts; and\\n\\nhe stood outside the churches and watched the crowds pass in, bearing\\n\\ngifts to the Holy Mother and Child.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last the fairies straightened their caps and cried, \"Now for the\\n\\ngreat hall in the King of England\\'s palace!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhist--and away they went, and Teig after them; and the first thing he\\n\\nknew he was in London, not an arm\\'s length from the King\\'s throne. It\\n\\nwas a grander sight than he had seen in any other country. The hall was\\n\\nfilled entirely with lords and ladies; and the great doors were open for\\n\\nthe poor and the homeless to come in and warm themselves by the King\\'s\\n\\nfire and feast from the King\\'s table. And many a hungry soul did the\\n\\nKing serve with his own hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nThose that had anything to give gave it in return. It might be a bit of\\n\\nmusic played on a harp or a pipe, or it might be a dance or a song; but\\n\\nmore often it was a wish, just, for good luck and safekeeping.\\n\\n\\n\\nTeig was so taken up with the watching that he never heard the fairies\\n\\nwhen they wished themselves off; moreover, he never saw the wee girl\\n\\nthat was fed, and went laughing away. But he heard a bit of her song as\\n\\nshe passed through the door:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Feed ye the hungry an\\' rest ye the weary,\\n\\n    This ye must do for the sake of Our Mary.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the anger had Teig. \"I\\'ll stop your pestherin\\' tongue, once an\\' for\\n\\nall time!\" and, catching the cap from his head, he threw it after her.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo sooner was the cap gone than every soul in the hall saw him. The next\\n\\nmoment they were about him, catching at his coat and crying:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where is he from, what does he here? Bring him before the King!\" And\\n\\nTeig was dragged along by a hundred hands to the throne where the King\\n\\nsat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He was stealing food,\" cried one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He was robbing the King\\'s jewels,\" cried another.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He looks evil,\" cried a third. \"Kill him!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd in a moment all the voices took it up and the hall rang with: \"Aye,\\n\\nkill him, kill him!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTeig\\'s legs took to trembling, and fear put the leash on his tongue; but\\n\\nafter a long silence he managed to whisper:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have done evil to no one--no one!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe,\" said the King; \"but have ye done good? Come, tell us, have ye\\n\\ngiven aught to any one this night? If ye have, we will pardon ye.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNot a word could Teig say--fear tightened the leash --for he was knowing\\n\\nfull well there was no good to him that night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then ye must die,\" said the King. \"Will ye try hanging or beheading?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hanging, please, your Majesty,\" said Teig.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe guards came rushing up and carried him off. But as he was crossing\\n\\nthe threshold of the hall a thought sprang at him and held him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Your Majesty,\" he called after him, \"will ye grant me a last request?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I will,\" said the King.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thank ye. There\\'s a wee red cap that I\\'m mortal fond of, and I lost it\\n\\na while ago; if I could be hung with it on, I would hang a deal more\\n\\ncomfortable.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe cap was found and brought to Teig.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Clip, clap, clip, clap, for my wee red cap, I wish I was home,\" he\\n\\nsang.\\n\\n\\n\\nUp and over the heads of the dumfounded guard he flew, and--whist--and\\n\\naway out of sight. When he opened his eyes again, he was sitting close\\n\\nby his own hearth, with the fire burnt low. The hands of the clock were\\n\\nstill, the bolt was fixed firm in the door. The fairies\\' lights were\\n\\ngone, and the only bright thing was the candle burning in old Barney\\'s\\n\\ncabin across the road.\\n\\n\\n\\nA running of feet sounded outside, and then the snatch of a song:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"\\'Tis well that ye mind--ye who sit by the fire--\\n\\n    That the Lord he was born in a dark and cold byre.\\n\\n                                  Mhuire as traugh!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wait ye, whoever ye are!\" and Teig was away to the corner, digging fast\\n\\nat the loose clay, as a terrier digs at a bone. He filled his hands full\\n\\nof the shining gold, then hurried to the door, unbarring it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe miller\\'s wee Cassie stood there, peering at him out of the darkness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Take those to the widow O\\'Donnelly, do ye hear? And take the rest to\\n\\nthe store. Ye tell Jamie to bring up all that he has that is eatable an\\'\\n\\ndhrinkable; and to the neighbors ye say, \\'Teig\\'s keepin\\' the feast this\\n\\nnight.\\' Hurry now!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTeig stopped a moment on the threshold until the tramp of her feet had\\n\\ndied away; then he made a hollow of his two hands and called across the\\n\\nroad:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hey there, Barney, will ye come over for a sup?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 13: By permission from _This Way to Christmas,_ by Ruth Sawyer\\n\\nDurand.

Among them all her feet were the lightest and\\n\\nher laugh the merriest, and in the telling of tales not one of them\\n\\ncould touch her. So if ever any among them were plotting mischief in\\n\\ntheir hearts, they would say to her:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Echo, thou weaver of words, go thou and sit beside Hera in her bower,\\n\\nand beguile her with a tale that she come not forth and find us. See\\n\\nthou make it a long one, Echo, and we will give thee a garland to twine\\n\\nin thy hair.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd Echo would laugh a gay laugh, which rang through the grove.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What will you do when she tires of my tales?\" she asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"When that time comes we shall see,\" said they.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo with another laugh she would trip away and cast herself on the grass\\n\\nat Hera\\'s feet. When Hera looked upon Echo her stern brow would relax,\\n\\nand she would smile upon her and stroke her hair.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What hast thou come for now, thou sprite?\" she would ask.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I had a great longing to talk with thee, great Hera,\" she would answer,\\n\\n\"and I have a tale--a wondrous new tale--to tell thee.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thy tales are as many as the risings of the sun, Echo, and each one of\\n\\nthem as long as an old man\\'s beard.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The day is yet young, mother,\" she would say, \"and the tales I have\\n\\ntold thee before are as mud which is trampled underfoot by the side of\\n\\nthe one I shall tell thee now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Go to, then,\" said Hera, \"and if it pleases me I will listen to the\\n\\nend.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Echo would sit upon the grass at Hera\\'s feet, and with her eyes fixed\\n\\nupon her face she would tell her tale. She had the gift of words, and,\\n\\nmoreover, she had seen and heard many strange things which she alone\\n\\ncould tell of. These she would weave into romances, adding to them as\\n\\nbest pleased her, or taking from them at will; for the best of\\n\\ntale-tellers are those who can lie, but who mingle in with their lies\\n\\nsome grains of truth which they have picked from their own experience.\\n\\nAnd Hera would forget her watchfulness and her jealousies, and listen\\n\\nentranced, while the magic of Echo\\'s words made each scene live before\\n\\nher eyes. Meanwhile the nymphs would sport to their hearts\\' content and\\n\\nnever fear her anger.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut at last came the black day of reckoning when Hera found out the\\n\\nprank which Echo had played upon her so long, and the fire of her wrath\\n\\nflashed forth like lightning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The gift whereby thou hast deceived me shall be thine no more,\" she\\n\\ncried. \"Henceforward thou shalt be dumb till some one else has spoken,\\n\\nand then, even if thou wilt, thou shalt not hold thy tongue, but must\\n\\nneeds repeat once more the last words that have been spoken.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Alas! alas!\" cried the nymphs in chorus.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Alas! alas!\" cried Echo after them, and could say no more, though she\\n\\nlonged to speak and beg Hera to forgive her. So did it come to pass that\\n\\nshe lost her voice, and could only say that which others put in her\\n\\nmouth, whether she wished it or no.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, it chanced one day that the young Narcissus strayed away from his\\n\\ncompanions in the hunt, and when he tried to find them he only wandered\\n\\nfurther, and lost his way upon the lonely heights of Helicon. He was\\n\\nnow in the bloom of his youth, nearing manhood, and fair as a flower in\\n\\nspring, and all who saw him straightway loved him and longed for him.\\n\\nBut, though his face was smooth and soft as maiden\\'s, his heart was hard\\n\\nas steel; and while many loved him and sighed for him, they could kindle\\n\\nno answering flame in his breast, but he would spurn them, and treat\\n\\nthem with scorn, and go on his way, nothing caring. When he was born,\\n\\nthe blind seer Teiresias had prophesied concerning him:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So long as he sees not himself he shall live and be happy.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd his words came true, for Narcissus cared for neither man nor woman,\\n\\nbut only for his own pleasure; and because he was so fair that all who\\n\\nsaw him loved him for his beauty, he found it easy to get from them what\\n\\nhe would. But he himself knew naught of love, and therefore but little\\n\\nof grief; for love at the best brings joy and sorrow hand in hand, and\\n\\nif unreturned, it brings naught but pain.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, when the nymphs saw Narcissus wandering alone through the woods,\\n\\nthey, too, loved him for his beauty, and they followed him wherever he\\n\\nwent. But because he was a mortal they were shy of him, and would not\\n\\nshow themselves, but hid behind the trees and rocks so that he should\\n\\nnot see them; and amongst the others Echo followed him, too. At last,\\n\\nwhen he found he had really wandered astray, he began to shout for one\\n\\nof his companions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ho, there! where art thou?\" he cried.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where art thou?\" answered Echo.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he heard the voice, he stopped and listened, but he could hear\\n\\nnothing more. Then he called again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am here in the wood--Narcissus.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"In the wood--Narcissus,\" said she.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come hither,\" he cried.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come hither,\" she answered.\\n\\n\\n\\nWondering at the strange voice which answered him, he looked all about,\\n\\nbut could see no one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Art thou close at hand?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Close at hand,\" answered Echo.\\n\\n\\n\\nWondering the more at seeing no one, he went forward in the direction of\\n\\nthe voice. Echo, when she found he was coming towards her, fled further,\\n\\nso that when next he called, her voice sounded far away. But wherever\\n\\nshe was, he still followed after her, and she saw that he would not let\\n\\nher escape; for wherever she hid, if he called, she had to answer, and\\n\\nso show him her hiding-place. By now they had come to an open space in\\n\\nthe trees, where the green lawn sloped down to a clear pool in the\\n\\nhollow. Here by the margin of the water she stood, with her back to the\\n\\ntall, nodding bulrushes, and as Narcissus came out from the trees she\\n\\nwrung her hands, and the salt tears dropped from her eyes; for she loved\\n\\nhim, and longed to speak to him, and yet she could not say a word. When\\n\\nhe saw her he stopped.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Art thou she who calls me?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who calls me?\" she answered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have told thee, Narcissus,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Narcissus,\" she cried, and held out her arms to him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who art thou?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who art thou?\" said she.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Have I not told thee,\" he said impatiently, \"Narcissus?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Narcissus,\" she said again, and still held out her hands beseechingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tell me,\" he cried, \"who art thou and why dost thou call me?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why dost thou call me?\" said she.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this he grew angry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Maiden, whoever thou art, thou hast led me a pretty dance through the\\n\\nwoods, and now thou dost nought but mock me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thou dost nought but mock me,\" said she.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this he grew yet more angry, and began to abuse her, but every word\\n\\nof abuse that he spoke she hurled back at him again. At last, tired out\\n\\nwith his wanderings and with anger, he threw himself on the grass by the\\n\\npool, and would not look at her nor speak to her again. For a time she\\n\\nstood beside him weeping, and longing to speak to him and explain, but\\n\\nnever a word could she utter. So at last in her misery she left him, and\\n\\nwent and hid herself behind a rock close by. After a while, when his\\n\\nanger had cooled down somewhat, Narcissus remembered he was very\\n\\nthirsty, and noticing for the first time the clear pool beside him, he\\n\\nbent over the edge of the bank to drink. As he held out his hand to take\\n\\nthe water, he saw looking up towards him a face which was the fairest\\n\\nface he had ever looked on, and his heart, which never yet had known\\n\\nwhat love was, at last was set on fire by the face in the pool. With a\\n\\nsigh he held out both his arms toward it, and the figure also held out\\n\\ntwo arms to him, and Echo from the rock answered back his sigh. When he\\n\\nsaw the figure stretching out towards him and heard the sigh, he thought\\n\\nthat his love was returned, and he bent down closer to the water and\\n\\nwhispered, \"I love thee.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I love thee,\" answered Echo from the rock.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt these words he bent down further, and tried to clasp the figure in\\n\\nhis arms, but as he did so, it vanished away. The surface of the pool\\n\\nwas covered with ripples, and he found he was clasping empty water to\\n\\nhis breast. So he drew back and waited awhile, thinking he had been\\n\\nover-hasty. In time, the ripples died away and the face appeared again\\n\\nas clear as before, looking up at him longingly from the water. Once\\n\\nagain he bent towards it, and tried to clasp it, and once again it fled\\n\\nfrom his embrace. Time after time he tried, and always the same thing\\n\\nhappened, and at last he gave up in despair, and sat looking down into\\n\\nthe water, with the teardrops falling from his eyes; and the figure in\\n\\nthe pool wept, too, and looked up at him with a look of longing and\\n\\ndespair. The longer he looked, the more fiercely did the flame of love\\n\\nburn in his breast, till at length he could bear it no more, but\\n\\ndetermined to reach the desire of his heart or die. So for the last time\\n\\nhe leaned forward, and when he found that once again he was clasping the\\n\\nempty water, he threw himself from the bank into the pool, thinking that\\n\\nin the depths, at any rate, he would find his love. But he found naught\\n\\nbut death among the weeds and stones of the pool, and knew not that it\\n\\nwas his own face he loved reflected in the water below him. Thus were\\n\\nthe words of the prophet fulfilled, \"So long as he sees not himself he\\n\\nshall live and be happy.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nEcho, peeping out from the rock, saw all that had happened, and when\\n\\nNarcissus cast himself into the pool she rushed forward, all too late,\\n\\nto stop him. When she found she could not save him, she cast herself on\\n\\nthe grass by the pool and wept and wept, till her flesh and her bones\\n\\nwasted away with weeping, and naught but her voice remained and the\\n\\ncurse that was on her. So to this day she lives, a formless voice\\n\\nhaunting rocks and caves and vaulted halls. Herself no man has seen\\n\\nsince the day Narcissus saw her wringing her hands for love of him\\n\\nbeside the nodding bulrushes, and no man ever shall see again. But her\\n\\nvoice we all have heard repeating our words when we thought that no one\\n\\nwas by; and though now she will say whatever we bid her, if once the\\n\\ncurse were removed, the cry of her soul would be:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Narcissus, Narcissus, my love, come back--come back to me!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the side of the clear brown pool, on the grass that Echo had watered\\n\\nwith her tears, there sprang up a sweet-scented flower, with a pure\\n\\nwhite face and a crown of gold. And to this day in many a land men call\\n\\nthat flower \"Narcissus,\" after the lad who, for love of his own fair\\n\\nface, was drowned in the waters of Helicon.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: HOW THE ASS BECAME A MAN AGAIN]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 14: From _Children of the Dawn,_ by Elsie Finnimore Buckley.\\n\\nStokes, London.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW THE ASS BECAME A MAN AGAIN[15]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nONCE upon a time there lived a young man who would do nothing from\\n\\nmorning till night but amuse himself. His parents were dead and had left\\n\\nhim plenty of money, but this was fast vanishing, and his friends shook\\n\\ntheir heads sadly, for when the money was gone they did not see where\\n\\nmore was to come from. It was not that Apuleius (for that was the name\\n\\nof the youth) was stupid. He might have been a good soldier, or a\\n\\nscholar, or a worker in gold, if so it had pleased him, but from a child\\n\\nhe had refused to do anything useful, and roamed about the city all day\\n\\nlong in search of adventures. The only kind of learning to which he paid\\n\\nany heed was magic, and when he was in the house he would spend hours\\n\\nporing over great books of spells.\\n\\n\\n\\nFond though he was of sorcery, he was too lazy to leave the town and its\\n\\npleasures--the chariot-racing, the theater, and the wrestling, and to\\n\\ntravel in search of the wizards who were renowned for their skill in the\\n\\nart. However, the time came when, very unwillingly, he was forced to\\n\\ntake a journey into Thessaly, to see to the proper working of some\\n\\nsilver mines in which he had a share, and Thessaly, as everybody knows,\\n\\nis the home of all magic. So when Apuleius arrived at the town of\\n\\nHypata, where dwelt the man Milo, overseer of his mines, he was prepared\\n\\nto believe that all he saw was enchanted.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, if Thessaly is the country of magic, it is also the country of\\n\\nrobbers, and Apuleius soon noticed that everybody he met was in fear of\\n\\nthem. Indeed, they made this fear the excuse for all sorts of mean and\\n\\nfoolish ways. For instance, Milo, who loved money and could not bear to\\n\\nspend a farthing, refused to have any seats in his house that could be\\n\\nremoved, and in consequence there was nothing to sit upon except two\\n\\nmarble chairs fixed to the wall. As there was only room in these for one\\n\\nperson, the wife of Milo had to retire to her own chamber when the young\\n\\nman entered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It was no use,\" explained Milo, \"in laying out money on moveable seats,\\n\\nwith robbers about. They would be sure to hear of it and to break into\\n\\nthe house.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nUnlike his guest, Milo was always occupied in adding to his wealth in\\n\\none form or another. Sometimes he sent down a train of mules to the\\n\\nsea, and bought merchandise which the ships had carried from Babylon or\\n\\nEgypt, to sell it again at a high price. Then he dealt in sheep and\\n\\ncattle, and when he thought he might do so with safety made false\\n\\nreturns of the silver that was dug up from the mines, and kept the\\n\\ndifference for himself. But most often he lent large sums at high\\n\\ninterest to the young men of the neighborhood, and so cunning was he\\n\\nthat, whoever else might be ruined, Milo managed to make large profits.\\n\\n\\n\\nApuleius knew very well that his steward was in his way as great a\\n\\nrobber as any in Thessaly, but, as usual, he found it too much trouble\\n\\nto look into the matter. So he laughed and jested with the miser, and\\n\\nnext morning went out to the public baths and then took a stroll through\\n\\nthe city. It was full of statues of the famous men to whom Hypata had\\n\\ngiven birth; but as Apuleius had made up his mind that nothing in\\n\\nThessaly _could_ be what it seemed, he supposed that they were living\\n\\npeople who had fallen under enchantment, and that the oxen whom he met\\n\\ndriven through the streets had once been men and women.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne evening he was returning as usual from a walk when he saw from afar\\n\\nthree figures before Milo\\'s house, whom he at once guessed were trying\\n\\nto force an entrance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here is an adventure at last,\" thought he, and, keeping in the shadow,\\n\\nhe stole softly up behind them, and drawing his short sword he stabbed\\n\\neach one to the heart. Then, without waiting to see what more would\\n\\nbefall, he left them where they were and entered the house by a door at\\n\\nthe back.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said nothing of what had happened to Milo his host, but the next day,\\n\\nbefore he had left his bed, a summons was brought him by one of the\\n\\nslaves to appear before the court at noon on a charge of murder. As has\\n\\nbeen seen, Apuleius was a brave man and did not fear to face three times\\n\\nhis number, but his heart quailed at the thought of a public trial.\\n\\nStill, he was wise enough to know that there was no help for it, and at\\n\\nthe hour appointed he was in his place.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first witnesses against him were two women with black veils covering\\n\\nthem from head to foot. At the sound of the herald\\'s trumpet, one of the\\n\\ntwo stepped forward and accused him of compassing the death of her\\n\\nhusband. When she had ended her plaint the herald blew another blast,\\n\\nand another veiled woman came forward and charged him with her son\\'s\\n\\nmurder. Then the herald inquired if there was not yet a third victim,\\n\\nbut was answered that his wound was slight, and that he was able to roam\\n\\nthrough the city.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the witnesses had been called, the judge pronounced sentence.\\n\\nApuleius the murderer was condemned to death, but he must first of all\\n\\nbe tortured, so that he might reveal the names of the men who had\\n\\nabetted him. By order of the court, horrible instruments were brought\\n\\nforward which chilled the blood of Apuleius in his veins. But to his\\n\\nsurprise, when he looked round to see if none would be his friend, he\\n\\nnoticed that every one, from the judge to the herald, was shaking with\\n\\nlaughter. His amazement was increased when with a trembling voice one of\\n\\nthe women demanded that the bodies should be produced, so that the judge\\n\\nmight be induced to feel more pity and to order more tortures. The judge\\n\\nassented to this, and two bodies were carried into court shrouded in\\n\\nwrappings, and the order was given that Apuleius himself should remove\\n\\nthe wrappings.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe face of the young man grew white as he heard the words of the judge,\\n\\nfor even a hardened criminal cares but little to touch the corpse of a\\n\\nman whom he has murdered. But he dared not disobey, and walked slowly to\\n\\nthe place where the dead bodies lay. He shrank for a moment as he took\\n\\nthe cloth in his hands, but his guards were behind him, and calling up\\n\\nall his courage, he withdrew it. A shout of laughter pealed out behind\\n\\nhim, and to his amazement he saw that his victims of the previous night\\n\\nhad been three huge leather bottles and not men at all!\\n\\n\\n\\nAs soon as Apuleius found out the trick that had been played on him he\\n\\nwas no less amused than the rest, but in the midst of his mirth a sudden\\n\\nthought struck him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How was it you managed to make them alive?\" asked he, \"for alive they\\n\\nwere, and battering themselves against the door of the house.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, that is simple enough when one has a sorceress for a mistress,\"\\n\\nanswered a damsel, who was standing by. \"She burned the hairs of some\\n\\ngoats and wove spells over them, so that the animals to whom the hairs\\n\\nand skins had once belonged became endowed with life and tried to enter\\n\\ntheir former dwelling.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They may well say that Thessaly is the home of wonders,\" cried the\\n\\nyoung man. \"But do you think that your mistress would let me see her at\\n\\nwork? I would pay her well--and you also,\" he added.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It might be managed perhaps, without her knowledge,\" answered Fotis,\\n\\nfor such was the girl\\'s name; \"but you must hold yourself in readiness\\n\\nafter nightfall, for I cannot tell what evening she may choose to cast\\n\\noff her own shape.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nApuleius promised readily that he would not stir out after sunset, and\\n\\nthe damsel went her way.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat very evening, Hesperus had scarcely risen from his bed when Fotis\\n\\nknocked at the door of the house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come hither, and quickly,\" she said; and without stopping to question\\n\\nher Apuleius hastened by her side to the dwelling of the witch Pamphile.\\n\\nEntering softly, they crept along a dark passage, where they could peep\\n\\nthrough a crack in the wall and see Pamphile at work. She was in the act\\n\\nof rubbing her body with essences from a long row of bottles which stood\\n\\nin a cupboard in the wall, chanting to herself spells as she did so.\\n\\nSlowly, feathers began to sprout from her head to her feet. Her arms\\n\\nvanished, her nails became claws, her eyes grew round and her nose\\n\\nhooked, and a little brown owl flew out of the window.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, are you satisfied?\" asked Fotis, but Apuleius shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not yet,\" he answered. \"I want to know how she transforms herself into\\n\\na woman again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That is quite easy, you may be sure,\" replied Fotis. \"My mistress\\n\\nnever runs any risks. A cup of water from a spring, with some laurel\\n\\nleaves and anise floating in it, is all that she needs. I have seen her\\n\\ndo it a thousand times.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Turn me into a nightingale, then, and I will give you five hundred\\n\\nsesterces,\" cried Apuleius eagerly; and Fotis, tempted by the thought of\\n\\nso much money, agreed to do what he wished.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut either Fotis was not so skilful as she thought herself, or in her\\n\\nhurry she neglected to observe that the bird bottles were all on one\\n\\nshelf, and the beast bottles on another, for when she had rubbed the\\n\\nointment over the young man\\'s chest something fearful happened. Instead\\n\\nof his arms disappearing, they stretched downwards; his back became\\n\\nbent, his face long and narrow, while a browny-gray fur covered his\\n\\nbody. Apuleius had been changed, not into a nightingale, but into an\\n\\nass!\\n\\n\\n\\nA loud scream broke from Fotis when she saw what she had done, and\\n\\nApuleius, glancing at a polished mirror from Corinth which hung on the\\n\\nwalls, beheld with horror the fate that had overtaken him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Quick, quick! fetch the water, and I will seek for the laurels and\\n\\nanise,\" he cried. \"I do not want to be an ass at all; my arms and back\\n\\nare aching already, and if I am not swiftly restored to my own shape I\\n\\nshall not be able to overthrow the champion in the wrestling match\\n\\nto-morrow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Fotis ran out to draw the water from the spring, while Apuleius\\n\\nopened some boxes with his teeth, and soon found the anise and laurels.\\n\\nBut alas! Fotis had deceived herself. The charm which was meant for a\\n\\nbird would not work with a beast, and, what was worse, when Apuleius\\n\\ntried to speak to her and beg her to try something else, he found he\\n\\ncould only bray!\\n\\n\\n\\nIn despair the girl took down the book of spells, and began to turn over\\n\\nthe pages; while the ass, who was still a man in all but his outward\\n\\nform, glanced eagerly down them also. At length he gave a loud bray of\\n\\nsatisfaction, and rubbed his nose on a part of the long scroll.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Of course, I remember now,\" cried Fotis with delight. \"What a comfort\\n\\nthat nothing more is needed to restore you to your proper shape than a\\n\\nhandful of rose leaves!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe mind of Apuleius was now quite easy, but his spirits fell again when\\n\\nFotis reminded him that he could no longer expect to be received by his\\n\\nfriends, but must lie in the stable of Milo, with his own horse, and be\\n\\ntended, if he was tended at all, by his own servant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"However, it will not be for long,\" she added consolingly. \"In the\\n\\ncorner of the stable is a little shrine to the goddess of horses, and\\n\\nevery day fresh roses are placed before it. Before the sun sets\\n\\nto-morrow you will be yourself again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSlowly and shyly Apuleius slunk along lonely paths till he came to the\\n\\nstable of Milo. The door was open, but, as he entered, his horse, who\\n\\nwas fastened with a sliding cord, kicked wildly at him, and caught him\\n\\nright on the shoulder. But before the horse could deal another blow\\n\\nApuleius had sprung hastily on one side, and had hidden himself in a\\n\\ndark corner, where he slept soundly.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe moon was shining brightly when he awoke, and looking round, he saw,\\n\\nas Fotis had told him, the shrine of Hippone, with a branch of\\n\\nsweet-smelling pink roses lying before it. It was rather high up, he\\n\\nthought, but, when he reared himself on his hind legs, he would surely\\n\\nbe tall enough to reach it. So up he got, and trod softly over the\\n\\nstraw, till he drew near the shrine, when with a violent effort he threw\\n\\nup his forelegs into the air. Yes! it was all right, his nose was quite\\n\\nnear the roses; but just as he opened his mouth his balance gave way,\\n\\nand his front feet came heavily on the floor.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe noise brought the man, who was sleeping in another part of the\\n\\nstable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I see what you are at, you ugly beast,\" cried he; \"would you eat\\n\\nroses that I put there for the goddess? I don\\'t know who may be your\\n\\nmaster, or how you got here, but I will take care that you do no more\\n\\nmischief.\" So saying, he struck the ass several times with his fists,\\n\\nand then, putting a rope round his neck, tied him up in another part of\\n\\nthe stable.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow it happened that an hour or two later some of the most desperate\\n\\nrobbers in all Thessaly broke into the house of Milo, and, unheard by\\n\\nany one, took all the bags of money that the miser had concealed under\\n\\nsome loose stones in his cellar. It was clear that they could not carry\\n\\naway such heavy plunder without risk of the crime being discovered, but\\n\\nthey managed to get it quietly as far as the stable, where they gave the\\n\\nhorse some apples to put it in a good temper, while they thrust a turnip\\n\\ninto the mouth of Apuleius, who did not like it at all. Then they led\\n\\nout both the animals, and placed the sacks of money on their backs,\\n\\nafter which they all set out for the robbers\\' cave in the side of the\\n\\nmountain. As this, however, was some distance off, it took them many\\n\\nhours to reach it, and on the way they passed through a large deserted\\n\\ngarden, where rose bushes of all sorts grew like weeds. The pulse of\\n\\nApuleius bounded at the sight, and he had already stretched out his nose\\n\\ntowards them, when he suddenly remembered that if he should turn into a\\n\\nman in his present company he would probably be murdered by the robbers.\\n\\nWith a great effort, he left the roses alone, and tramped steadily on\\n\\nhis way.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt were long indeed to tell the adventures of Apuleius and the number of\\n\\nmasters whom he served. After some time he was captured by a soldier,\\n\\nand by him sold to two brothers, one a cook and the other a maker of\\n\\npastry, who were attached to the service of a rich man who lived in the\\n\\ncountry. This man did not allow any of his slaves to dwell in his house,\\n\\nexcept those who attended on him personally, and these two brothers\\n\\nlived in a tent on the other side of the garden, and the ass was given\\n\\nto them to send to and fro with savory dishes in his panniers.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe cook and his brother were both careful men, and always had a great\\n\\nstore of pastry and sweet things on their shelves, so that none might be\\n\\nlacking if their lord should command them. When they had done their work\\n\\nthey placed water and food for their donkey in a little shed which\\n\\nopened on to the tent, then, fastening the door so that no one could\\n\\nenter, they went out to enjoy the evening air.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn their return, it struck them that the tent looked unusually bare, and\\n\\nat length they perceived that this was because every morsel of pastry\\n\\nand sweets on the shelves had disappeared, and nothing was left of them,\\n\\nnot so much as a crumb. There was no room for a thief to hide, so the\\n\\ntwo brothers supposed that, impossible it seemed, he must not only have\\n\\ngot _in_ but _out_ by the door, and, as their master might send for a\\n\\ntray of cakes at any moment, there was no help for it but to make a\\n\\nfresh supply. And so they did, and it took them more than half the night\\n\\nto do it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next evening the same thing happened again; and the next, and the\\n\\nnext, and the next.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, by accident, the cook went into the shed where the ass lay, and\\n\\ndiscovered a heap of corn and hay that reached nearly to the roof.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, you rascal!\" he exclaimed, bursting out laughing as he spoke. \"So\\n\\nit is you who have cost us our sleep! Well, well, I dare say I should\\n\\nhave done the same myself, for cakes and sweets are certainly nicer than\\n\\ncorn and hay.\" And the donkey brayed in answer, and winked an eye at\\n\\nhim, and, more amused than before, the man went away to tell his\\n\\nbrother.\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course it was not long before the story reached the ears of their\\n\\nmaster, who instantly sent to buy the donkey, and bade one of his\\n\\nservants, who had a taste for such things, teach him fresh tricks. This\\n\\nthe man was ready enough to do, for the fame of this wonderful creature\\n\\nsoon spread far and wide, and the citizens of the town thronged the\\n\\ndoors of his stable. And while the servant reaped much gold by making\\n\\nthe ass display his accomplishments, the master gained many friends\\n\\namong the people, and was soon made chief ruler.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor five years Apuleius stayed in the house of Thyasus, and ate as many\\n\\nsweet cakes as he chose; and if he wanted more than were given him he\\n\\nwandered down to the tent of his old masters, and swept the shelves bare\\n\\nas of yore. At the end of the five years Thyasus proclaimed that a great\\n\\nfeast would be held in his garden, after which plays would be acted, and\\n\\nin one of them his donkey should appear.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, though Apuleius loved eating and drinking, he was not at all fond\\n\\nof doing tricks in public, and as the day drew near he grew more and\\n\\nmore resolved that he would take no part in the entertainment. So one\\n\\nwarm moonlight night he stole out of his stable, and galloped as fast as\\n\\nhe could for ten miles, when he reached the sea. He was hot and tired\\n\\nwith his long run, and the sea looked cool and pleasant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is years since I have had a bath,\" thought he, \"or wetted anything\\n\\nbut my feet. I will take one now; it will make me feel like a man\\n\\nagain\"; and into the water he went, and splashed about with\\n\\njoy, which would much have surprised any one who had seen him, for asses\\n\\ndo not in general care about washing.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he came back to dry land once more, he shook himself all over, and\\n\\nheld his head first on one side and then on the other, so that the water\\n\\nmight run out of his long ears. After that he felt quite comfortable,\\n\\nand lay down to sleep under a tree.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was awakened some hours later by the sound of voices singing a hymn,\\n\\nand, raising his head, he saw a vast crowd of people trooping down to\\n\\nthe shore to hold the festival of their goddess, and in their midst\\n\\nwalked the high priest crowned with a wreath of roses.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this sight hope was born afresh in the heart of Apuleius. It was long\\n\\nindeed since he had beheld any roses, for Thyasus fancied they made him\\n\\nill, and would not suffer any one to grow them in the city. So he drew\\n\\nnear to the priest as he passed by, and gazed at him so wistfully that,\\n\\nmoved by some sudden impulse, the pontiff lifted the wreath from his\\n\\nhead, and held it out to him, while the people drew to one side,\\n\\nfeeling that something was happening which they did not understand.\\n\\n\\n\\nScarcely had Apuleius swallowed one of the roses, when the ass\\'s skin\\n\\nfell from him, his back straightened itself, and his face once more\\n\\nbecame fair and rosy. Then he turned and joined in the hymn, and there\\n\\nwas not a man among them all with a sweeter voice or more thankful\\n\\nspirit than that of Apuleius.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: HOW ALEXANDER THE KING GOT THE WATER OF LIFE]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 15: Reprinted by permission from _The Red Book of Romance_.\\n\\nEdited by Andrew Lang.

For this service the little\\n\\n\"Aleko\" is to be helped with his lessons. By way of getting acquainted\\n\\nthe old man asks, \"Tell me, now, what do they call you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They call me Aleko.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"From where?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My mother lives in Megaloupolis, and I was born there and the little\\n\\nones, but my father was not from there.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nKyr Themistocli noticed the past tense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He is dead, your father?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, it is two years ago that he died.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And from where was he?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"From Siatista.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, a Macedonian! And what was his name?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Philippos Vasiliou.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So your name is Alexandros Vasiliou?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAleko nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Alexander of the King! Alexander the son of Philip! Your master has\\n\\ntaught you about him at school?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said Aleko, frowning.\\n\\n\\n\\n     The old man smiled. There is a story about him which you have not\\n\\n     heard perhaps. Do you know how _Alexander the King got the Water of\\n\\n     Life?_\"\\n\\n\\n\\n     Aleko shook his head: \"We have not reached such a part.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n     \"Well, I will tell you about it.  Listen:--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"WHEN Alexander the King had conquered all the Kingdoms of the world,\\n\\nand when all the universe trembled at his glance, he called before him\\n\\nthe most celebrated magicians of those days and said to them:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Ye who are wise, and who know all that is written in the Book of Fate,\\n\\ntell me what I must do to live for many years and to enjoy this world\\n\\nwhich I have made mine?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'O King!\\' said the magicians, \\'great is thy power! But what is written\\n\\nin the Book of Fate is written, and no one in Heaven or on Earth can\\n\\nefface it. There is one thing only, that can make thee enjoy thy kingdom\\n\\nand thy glory beyond the lives of men; that can make thee endure as long\\n\\nas the hills, but it is very hard to accomplish.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'I did not ask ye,\\' said the great King Alexander, \\'whether it be hard,\\n\\nI asked only what it was.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'O King, we are at thy feet to command! Know then that he alone who\\n\\ndrinks of the Water of Life need not fear death. But he who seeks this\\n\\nwater, must pass through two mountains which open and close constantly,\\n\\nand scarce a bird on the wing can fly between them and not be crushed to\\n\\ndeath. The bones lie in high piles, of the king\\'s sons who have lost\\n\\ntheir lives in this terrible trap. But if thou shouldst pass safely\\n\\nthrough the closing mountains, even then thou wilt find beyond them a\\n\\nsleepless dragon who guards the Water of Life. Him also must thou slay\\n\\nbefore thou canst take the priceless treasure.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then Alexander the King smiled, and ordered his slaves to bring forth\\n\\nhis horse Bucephalus, who had no wings yet flew like a bird. The king\\n\\nmounted on his back and the good horse neighed for joy. With one\\n\\ntriumphant bound he was through the closing mountains so swiftly that\\n\\nonly three hairs of his flowing tail were caught in between the giant\\n\\nrocks when they closed. Then Alexander the King slew the sleepless\\n\\ndragon, filled his vial with the Water of Life, and returned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But when he reached his palace, so weary was he that he fell into a\\n\\ndeep sleep and left the Water of Life unguarded. And it so happened that\\n\\nhis sister, not knowing the value of the water, threw it away. And some\\n\\nof the water fell on a wild onion plant, and that is why, to this day,\\n\\nwild onion plants never fade. Now when Alexander awoke, he stretched out\\n\\nhis hand to seize and drink the Water of Life and found naught; and in\\n\\nhis rage he would have killed the slaves who guarded his sleep, but his\\n\\nsister being of royal blood, could not hide the truth, and she told him\\n\\nthat, not knowing she had thrown the Water of Life away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then the king waxed terrible in his wrath, and he cast a curse upon his\\n\\nsister, and prayed that from the waist downward she might be turned into\\n\\na fish, and live always in the open sea far from all land and habitation\\n\\nof man. And the gods granted his prayer, so it happens that to this day\\n\\nthose who sail over the open sea in ships often see Alexander\\'s sister,\\n\\nhalf a woman and half a fish, tossing in the waves. Strange to say, she\\n\\ndoes not hate Alexander, and when a ship passes close to her she cries\\n\\nout: \\'Does Alexander live?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And should the captain, not knowing who it is that speaks, answer, \\'He\\n\\nis dead,\\' then the maid in her great grief tosses her white arms and her\\n\\nlong golden hair wildly about, and troubles the water, and sinks the\\n\\nship. But if, when the question comes up with the voice of the wind,\\n\\n\\'Does Alexander live?\\' the captain answers at once, \\'He lives and\\n\\nreigns,\\' then the maid\\'s heart is joyful and she sings sweet songs till\\n\\nthe ship is out of sight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And this is how sailors learn new love songs, and sing them when they\\n\\nreturn to land.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the old man ceased speaking Aleko waited a moment and then said\\n\\nslowly:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That is not true--but I like it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 16: By permission from _Under Greek Skies,_ by Julia\\n\\nDragoumis.

Every day he played at sticks, and he was almost always\\n\\nunlucky. Sometimes he would lose everything that he had, and would even\\n\\nlose things belonging to his father. His father had often scolded him\\n\\nabout gambling, and had told him that he ought to stop it. There were\\n\\ntwo things that he never staked; these two things were his shield and\\n\\nhis lance.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne day he played sticks for a long time, and when he got through he had\\n\\nlost everything that he had except these two things. When he went home\\n\\nat night to his father\\'s lodge he told his relations what he had done,\\n\\nand his father said to him:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My son, for a long time you have been doing this, and I have many times\\n\\nspoken to you about it. Now I have done. I cannot have you here any\\n\\nlonger. You cannot live here in my lodge or in this village. You must go\\n\\naway.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young man thought about it for a little while and then he said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I will go. It does not make much difference where I am.\" So he\\n\\ntook his shield and his spear and went out of the lodge and started to\\n\\ngo away from the village. When he got outside of the village and had\\n\\ngone some distance, he heard behind him a loud rushing sound like a\\n\\nstrong wind--the sound kept getting nearer and louder--and all at once\\n\\nit was above him, and then the sound stopped, and something spoke to him\\n\\nand said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I am here. I have come to find you. I have been sent, and am here\\n\\non purpose to get you and take you with me.\" The voice that spoke to him\\n\\nwas the Wind.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Wind took the young man up and carried him away towards the west.\\n\\nThey traveled many days, and passed over broad prairies and then across\\n\\nhigh mountains and then over high, wide plains and over other mountains\\n\\nuntil they came to the end of the world, where the sky bends down and\\n\\ntouches the ground. The last thing the young man saw was the gate\\n\\nthrough the edge of the sky. A great buffalo bull stands in this gateway\\n\\nand blocks it up. He had to move to one side to let the Wind and the\\n\\nyoung man pass through. Every year one hair drops from the hide of this\\n\\nbull. When all have fallen the end of the world will come.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter they had passed through this gate they went on, and it seemed as\\n\\nif they were passing over a big water. There was nothing to be seen\\n\\nexcept the sky and the water. At last they came to a land. Here were\\n\\nmany people--great crowds of them. The Wind told the young man:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"These are all waiters on the Father.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThey went on, and at last came to the Father\\'s lodge and went in. When\\n\\nthey had sat down the Father spoke to the young man and said to him:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My son, I have known you for a long time, and have watched you. I\\n\\nwanted to see you, and that is why I gave you bad luck at the sticks,\\n\\nand why I sent my Wind to bring you here. Your people are very hungry\\n\\nnow because they can find no buffalo, but I am going to give you\\n\\nsomething on which you can live, even when the buffalo fail.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he gave him three little sacks. The first contained squash seed;\\n\\nthe second beans, red and white; and the third corn, white, red, blue\\n\\nand yellow. The Father said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tie these sacks to your shield and do not lose them. When you get back\\n\\nto your people give each one some of the seeds and tell him to put them\\n\\nin the ground; then they will make more. These things are good to eat,\\n\\nbut the first year do not let the people eat them; let them put the\\n\\nyield away and the next year again put it in the ground. After that they\\n\\ncan eat a part of what grows, but they must always save some for seed.\\n\\nSo the people will always have something to eat with their buffalo meat,\\n\\nand something to depend on if the buffalo fail.\" The Father gave him\\n\\nalso a buffalo robe, and said to him:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"When you go back, the next day after you have got there, call all the\\n\\npeople together in your lodge, and give them what is in this robe, and\\n\\ntell them all these things. Now you can go back to your people.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Wind took the young man back. They traveled a long time, and at last\\n\\nthey came to the Pawnee village. The Wind put the young man down, and he\\n\\nwent into his father\\'s lodge and said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Father, I am here.\" But his father did not believe him, and said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is not you.\" He had been gone so long that they had thought him\\n\\ndead. Then he said to his mother:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mother, I am here.\" And his mother knew him and was glad that he had\\n\\nreturned.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this time the people had no buffalo. They had scouted far and near\\n\\nand could find none anywhere, and they were all very hungry. The little\\n\\nchildren cried with hunger. The next day after he got back, the young\\n\\nman sent out an old man to go through the camp and call all the people\\n\\nto come to his father\\'s lodge. When they were there, he opened his robe\\n\\nand spread it out, and it was covered with pieces of fat buffalo meat\\n\\npiled high. The young man gave to each person all he could carry, but\\n\\nwhile he was handing out the pieces, his father was trying to pull off\\n\\nthe robe the hind-quarters of the buffalo and hide them. He was afraid\\n\\nthat the young man might give away all the meat, and he wanted to save\\n\\nthis for their own lodge. But the young man said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Father, do not take this away. Do not touch anything. There is enough.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter he had given them the meat he showed them the sacks of seed and\\n\\ntold them what they were for, and explained to them that they must not\\n\\neat any the first year, but that they must always save some to plant,\\n\\nand the people listened. Then he said to them:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I hear that you have no buffalo. Come out to-morrow and I will show you\\n\\nwhere to go for buffalo.\" The People wondered where this could be, for\\n\\nthey had traveled far in all directions looking for buffalo. The next\\n\\nday they went out as he had told them, and the young man sent two boys\\n\\nto the top of a high hill close to camp, and told them to let him know\\n\\nwhat they saw from it. When the boys got to the top of the hill, they\\n\\nsaw down below them in the hollow a big band of buffalo.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the people learned that the buffalo were there, they all took their\\n\\narrows and ran out and chased the buffalo and made a big killing, so\\n\\nthat there was plenty in the camp and they made much dried meat. Four\\n\\ndays after this he again sent out the boys, and they found buffalo. Now\\n\\nthat they had plenty of meat they stayed in one place, and when spring\\n\\ncame the young man put the seed in the ground. When the people first saw\\n\\nthese strange plants growing they wondered at them, for they were new\\n\\nand different from anything that they had ever seen growing on the\\n\\nprairie. They liked the color of the young stalks, and the way they\\n\\ntasseled out, and the way the ears formed. They found that besides being\\n\\npretty to look at they were good to eat, for when the young man had\\n\\ngathered the crop he gave the people a little to taste, so that they\\n\\nmight know the words that he had spoken were true. The rest he kept for\\n\\nseed. Next season he gave all the people seed to plant, and after that\\n\\nthey always had these things.\\n\\n\\n\\nLater, this young man became one of the head men, and taught the people\\n\\nmany things. He told them that always when they killed buffalo they must\\n\\nbring the fattest and offer them to the Father. He taught them about the\\n\\nsacred bundles, and told them that they must put an ear of corn on the\\n\\nbundles and must keep a piece of fat in the bundles along with the corn,\\n\\nand that both must be kept out of sight. In the fall they should take\\n\\nthe ear of corn out of the bundles and rub the piece of fat over it.\\n\\nThus they would have good crops and plenty of food.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll these things the people did, and it was a help to them in their\\n\\nliving.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: WAUKEWA\\'S EAGLE]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 17: By special permission from _The Punishment of the Stingy,_\\n\\nby George Bird Grinnell. Copyright by Harper & Brothers.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWAUKEWA\\'S EAGLE[18]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nONE day, when the Indian boy Waukewa was hunting along the\\n\\nmountain-side, he found a young eagle with a broken wing, lying at the\\n\\nbase of a cliff. The bird had fallen from an aery on a ledge high above,\\n\\nand being too young to fly, had fluttered down the cliff and injured\\n\\nitself so severely that it was likely to die. When Waukewa saw it he was\\n\\nabout to drive one of his sharp arrows through its body, for the passion\\n\\nof the hunter was strong in him, and the eagle plunders many a fine fish\\n\\nfrom the Indian\\'s drying-frame. But a gentler impulse came to him as he\\n\\nsaw the young bird quivering with pain and fright at his feet, and he\\n\\nslowly unbent his bow, put the arrow in his quiver, and stooped over the\\n\\npanting eaglet. For fully a minute the wild eyes of the wounded bird and\\n\\nthe eyes of the Indian boy, growing gentler and softer as he gazed,\\n\\nlooked into one another. Then the struggling and panting of the young\\n\\neagle ceased; the wild, frightened look passed out of its eyes, and it\\n\\nsuffered Waukewa to pass his hand gently over its ruffled and draggled\\n\\nfeathers. The fierce instinct to fight, to defend its threatened life,\\n\\nyielded to the charm of the tenderness and pity expressed in the boy\\'s\\n\\neyes; and from that moment Waukewa and the eagle were friends.\\n\\n\\n\\nWaukewa went slowly home to his father\\'s lodge, bearing the wounded\\n\\neaglet in his arms. He carried it so gently that the broken wing gave no\\n\\ntwinge of pain, and the bird lay perfectly still, never offering to\\n\\nstrike with its sharp beak the hands that clasped it.\\n\\n\\n\\nWarming some water over the fire at the lodge, Waukewa bathed the broken\\n\\nwing of the eagle, and bound it up with soft strips of skin. Then he\\n\\nmade a nest of ferns and grass inside the lodge, and laid the bird in\\n\\nit. The boy\\'s mother looked on with shining eyes. Her heart was very\\n\\ntender. From girlhood she had loved all the creatures of the woods, and\\n\\nit pleased her to see some of her own gentle spirit waking in the boy.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Waukewa\\'s father returned from hunting, he would have caught up the\\n\\nyoung eagle and wrung its neck. But the boy pleaded with him so eagerly,\\n\\nstooping over the captive and defending it with his small hands, that\\n\\nthe stern warrior laughed and called him his \"little squaw-heart.\" \"Keep\\n\\nit, then,\" he said, \"and nurse it until it is well. But then you must\\n\\nlet it go, for we will not raise up a thief in the lodges.\" So Waukewa\\n\\npromised that when the eagle\\'s wing was healed and grown so that it\\n\\ncould fly, he would carry it forth and give it its freedom.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a month--or, as the Indians say, a moon--before the young eagle\\'s\\n\\nwing had fully mended and the bird was old enough and strong enough to\\n\\nfly. And in the meantime Waukewa cared for it and fed it daily, and the\\n\\nfriendship between the boy and the bird grew very strong.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut at last the time came when the willing captive must be freed. So\\n\\nWaukewa carried it far away from the Indian lodges, where none of the\\n\\nyoung braves might see it hovering over and be tempted to shoot their\\n\\narrows at it, and there he let it go. The young eagle rose toward the\\n\\nsky in great circles, rejoicing in its freedom and its strange, new\\n\\npower of flight. But when Waukewa began to move away from the spot, it\\n\\ncame swooping down again; and all day long it followed him through the\\n\\nwoods as he hunted. At dusk, when Waukewa shaped his course for the\\n\\nIndian lodges, the eagle would have accompanied him. But the boy\\n\\nsuddenly slipped into a hollow tree and hid, and after a long time the\\n\\neagle stopped sweeping about in search of him and flew slowly and sadly\\n\\naway.\\n\\n\\n\\nSummer passed, and then winter; and spring came again, with its flowers\\n\\nand birds and swarming fish in the lakes and streams. Then it was that\\n\\nall the Indians, old and young, braves and squaws, pushed their light\\n\\ncanoes out from shore and with spear and hook waged pleasant war against\\n\\nthe salmon and the red-spotted trout. After winter\\'s long imprisonment,\\n\\nit was such joy to toss in the sunshine and the warm wind and catch\\n\\nsavory fish to take the place of dried meats and corn!\\n\\n\\n\\nAbove the great falls of the Apahoqui the salmon sported in the cool,\\n\\nswinging current, darting under the lee of the rocks and leaping full\\n\\nlength in the clear spring air. Nowhere else were such salmon to be\\n\\nspeared as those which lay among the riffles at the head of the Apahoqui\\n\\nrapids. But only the most daring braves ventured to seek them there, for\\n\\nthe current was strong, and should a light canoe once pass the\\n\\ndanger-point and get caught in the rush of the rapids, nothing could\\n\\nsave it from going over the roaring falls.\\n\\n\\n\\nVery early in the morning of a clear April day, just as the sun was\\n\\nrising splendidly over the mountains, Waukewa launched his canoe a\\n\\nhalf-mile above the rapids of the Apahoqui, and floated downward, spear\\n\\nin hand, among the salmon-riffles. He was the only one of the Indian\\n\\nlads who dared fish above the falls. But he had been there often, and\\n\\nnever yet had his watchful eye and his strong paddle suffered the\\n\\ncurrent to carry his canoe beyond the danger-point. This morning he was\\n\\nalone on the river, having risen long before daylight to be first at the\\n\\nsport.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe riffles were full of salmon, big, lusty fellows, who glided about\\n\\nthe canoe on every side in an endless silver stream. Waukewa plunged his\\n\\nspear right and left, and tossed one glittering victim after another\\n\\ninto the bark canoe. So absorbed in the sport was he that for once he\\n\\ndid not notice when the canoe began to glide more swiftly among the\\n\\nrocks. But suddenly he looked up, caught his paddle, and dipped it\\n\\nwildly in the swirling water. The canoe swung sidewise, shivered, held\\n\\nits own against the torrent, and then slowly, inch by inch, began to\\n\\ncreep upstream toward the shore. But suddenly there was a loud, cruel\\n\\nsnap, and the paddle parted in the boy\\'s hands, broken just above the\\n\\nblade! Waukewa gave a cry of despairing agony. Then he bent to the\\n\\ngunwale of his canoe and with the shattered blade fought desperately\\n\\nagainst the current. But it was useless. The racing torrent swept him\\n\\ndownward; the hungry falls roared tauntingly in his ears.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the Indian boy knelt calmly upright in the canoe, facing the mist\\n\\nof the falls, and folded his arms. His young face was stern and lofty.\\n\\nHe had lived like a brave hitherto--now he would die like one.\\n\\n\\n\\nFaster and faster sped the doomed canoe toward the great cataract. The\\n\\nblack rocks glided away on either side like phantoms. The roar of the\\n\\nterrible waters became like thunder in the boy\\'s ears. But still he\\n\\ngazed calmly and sternly ahead, facing his fate as a brave Indian\\n\\nshould. At last he began to chant the death-song, which he had learned\\n\\nfrom the older braves. In a few moments all would be over. But he would\\n\\ncome before the Great Spirit with a fearless hymn upon his lips.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly a shadow fell across the canoe. Waukewa lifted his eyes and saw\\n\\na great eagle hovering over, with dangling legs, and a spread of wings\\n\\nthat blotted out the sun. Once more the eyes of the Indian boy and the\\n\\neagle met; and now it was the eagle who was master!\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a glad cry the Indian boy stood up in his canoe, and the eagle\\n\\nhovered lower. Now the canoe tossed up on that great swelling wave that\\n\\nclimbs to the cataract\\'s edge, and the boy lifted his hands and caught\\n\\nthe legs of the eagle. The next moment he looked down into the awful\\n\\ngulf of waters from its very verge. The canoe was snatched from beneath\\n\\nhim and plunged down the black wall of the cataract; but he and the\\n\\nstruggling eagle were floating outward and downwards through the cloud\\n\\nof mist. The cataract roared terribly, like a wild beast robbed of its\\n\\nprey. The spray beat and blinded, the air rushed upward as they fell.\\n\\nBut the eagle struggled on with his burden. He fought his way out of the\\n\\nmist and the flying spray. His great wings threshed the air with a\\n\\nwhistling sound. Down, down they sank, the boy and the eagle, but ever\\n\\nfarther from the precipice of water and the boiling whirlpool below. At\\n\\nlength, with a fluttering plunge, the eagle dropped on a sand-bar below\\n\\nthe whirlpool, and he and the Indian boy lay there a minute, breathless\\n\\nand exhausted. Then the eagle slowly lifted himself, took the air under\\n\\nhis free wings, and soared away, while the Indian boy knelt on the sand,\\n\\nwith shining eyes following the great bird till he faded into the gray\\n\\nof the cliffs.\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 18: By permission from Waukewa\\'s Eagle, by James Buckham, in\\n\\n_St. Nicholas_, Vol. XXVIII, Part I, The Century Company.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHALLOWE\\'EN AND MYSTERY STORIES\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: THE ROLL-CALL OF THE REEF]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE ROLL-CALL OF THE REEF[19]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"YES, sir,\" said my host the quarryman, reaching down the relics from\\n\\ntheir hook in the wall over the chimney-piece; \"they\\'ve hung there all\\n\\nmy time, and most of my father\\'s. The women won\\'t touch \\'em; they\\'re\\n\\nafraid of the story. So here they\\'ll dangle, and gather dust and smoke,\\n\\ntill another tenant comes and tosses \\'em out o\\' doors for rubbish. Whew!\\n\\n\\'tis coarse weather.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe went to the door, opened it, and stood studying the gale that beat\\n\\nupon his cottage-front, straight from the Manacle Reef. The rain drove\\n\\npast him into the kitchen aslant like threads of gold silk in the shine\\n\\nof the wreckwood fire. Meanwhile by the same firelight I examined the\\n\\nrelics on my knee. The metal of each was tarnished out of knowledge. But\\n\\nthe trumpet was evidently an old cavalry trumpet, and the threads of its\\n\\nparti-colored sling, though frayed and dusty, still hung together.\\n\\nAround the side-drum, beneath its cracked brown varnish, I could hardly\\n\\ntrace a royal coat-of-arms and a legend running, _Per Mare per\\n\\nTerram_--the motto of the Marines. Its parchment, though colored and\\n\\nscented with wood-smoke, was limp and mildewed, and I began to tighten\\n\\nup the straps--under which the drum-sticks had been loosely thrust\\n\\n--with the idle purpose of trying if some music might be got out of the\\n\\nold drum yet.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut as I turned it on my knee, I found the drum attached to the\\n\\ntrumpet-sling by a curious barrel-shaped padlock, and paused to examine\\n\\nthis. The body of the lock was composed of half a dozen brass rings, set\\n\\naccurately edge to edge; and, rubbing the brass with my thumb, I saw\\n\\nthat each of the six had a series of letters engraved around it.\\n\\n\\n\\nI knew the trick of it, I thought. Here was one of those word padlocks,\\n\\nonce so common; only to be opened by getting the rings to spell a\\n\\ncertain word, which the dealer confides to you.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy host shut and barred the door, and came back to the hearth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Twas just such a wind--east by south--that brought in what you\\'ve got\\n\\nbetween your hands. Back in the year \\'nine it was; my father has told me\\n\\nthe tale a score o\\' times. You\\'re twisting round the rings, I see. But\\n\\nyou\\'ll never guess the word. Parson Kendall, he made the word, and\\n\\nknocked down a couple o\\' ghosts in their graves with it, and when his\\n\\ntime came, he went to his own grave and took the word with him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Whose ghosts, Matthew?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You want the story, I see, sir. My father could tell it better than I\\n\\ncan. He was a young man in the year \\'nine, unmarried at the time, and\\n\\nliving in this very cottage just as I be. That\\'s how he came to get\\n\\nmixed up with the tale.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe took a chair, lit a short pipe, and unfolded the story in a low\\n\\nmusing voice, with his eyes fixed on the dancing violet flames.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, he\\'d ha\\' been about thirty year old in January of the year \\'nine.\\n\\nThe storm got up in the night o\\' the twenty-first o\\' that month. My\\n\\nfather was dressed and out long before daylight; he never was one to\\n\\n\\'bide in bed, let be that the gale by this time was pretty near lifting\\n\\nthe thatch over his head. Besides which, he\\'d fenced a small \\'taty-patch\\n\\nthat winter, down by Lowland Point, and he wanted to see if it stood the\\n\\nnight\\'s work. He took the path across Gunner\\'s Meadow--where they buried\\n\\nmost of the bodies afterward. The wind was right in his teeth at the\\n\\ntime, and once on the way (he\\'s told me this often) a great strip of\\n\\nore-weed came flying through the darkness and fetched him a slap on the\\n\\ncheek like a cold hand. But he made shift pretty well till he got to\\n\\nLowland, and then had to drop upon his hands and knees and crawl,\\n\\ndigging his fingers every now and then into the shingle to hold on, for\\n\\nhe declared to me that the stones, some of them as big as a man\\'s head,\\n\\nkept rolling and driving past till it seemed the whole foreshore was\\n\\nmoving westward under him. The fence was gone, of course; not a stick\\n\\nleft to show where it stood; so that, when first he came to the place,\\n\\nhe thought he must have missed his bearings. My father, sir, was a very\\n\\nreligious man; and if he reckoned the end of the world was at\\n\\nhand--there in the great wind and night, among the moving stones--you\\n\\nmay believe he was certain of it when he heard a gun fired, and, with\\n\\nthe same, saw a flame shoot up out of the darkness to windward, making a\\n\\nsudden fierce light in all the place about. All he could find to think\\n\\nor say was, \\'The Second Coming--The Second Coming! The Bridegroom\\n\\ncometh, and the wicked He will toss like a ball into a large country!\\'\\n\\nand being already upon his knees, he just bowed his head and \\'bided,\\n\\nsaying this over and over.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But by\\'m-by, between two squalls, he made bold to lift his head and\\n\\nlook, and then by the light--a bluish color \\'twas--he saw all the coast\\n\\nclear away to Manacle Point, and off the Manacles, in the thick of the\\n\\nweather, a sloop-of-war with top-gallants housed, driving stern foremost\\n\\ntoward the reef. It was she, of course, that was burning the flare. My\\n\\nfather could see the white streak and the ports of her quite plain as\\n\\nshe rose to it, a little outside the breakers, and he guessed easy\\n\\nenough that her captain had just managed to wear ship, and was trying to\\n\\nforce her nose to the sea with the help of her small bower anchor and\\n\\nthe scrap or two of canvas that hadn\\'t yet been blown out of her. But\\n\\nwhile he looked, she fell off, giving her broadside to it foot by foot,\\n\\nand drifting back on the breakers around Carn du and the Varses. The\\n\\nrocks lie so thick thereabouts, that \\'twas a toss up which she struck\\n\\nfirst; at any rate, my father couldn\\'t tell at the time, for just then\\n\\nthe flare died down and went out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, sir, he turned then in the dark and started back for Coverack to\\n\\ncry the dismal tidings--though well knowing ship and crew to be past any\\n\\nhope; and as he turned, the wind lifted him and tossed him forward \\'like\\n\\na ball,\\' as he\\'d been saying, and homeward along the foreshore. As you\\n\\nknow, \\'tis ugly work, even by daylight, picking your way among the\\n\\nstones there, and my father was prettily knocked about at first in the\\n\\ndark. But by this \\'twas nearer seven than six o\\'clock, and the day\\n\\nspreading. By the time he reached North Corner, a man could see to read\\n\\nprint; hows\\'ever he looked neither out to sea nor toward Coverack, but\\n\\nheaded straight for the first cottage--the same that stands above North\\n\\nCorner to-day. A man named Billy Ede lived there then, and when my\\n\\nfather burst into the kitchen bawling, \\'Wreck! wreck!\\' he saw Billy\\n\\nEde\\'s wife, Ann, standing there in her clogs, with a shawl over her\\n\\nhead, and her clothes wringing wet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Save the chap!\\' says Billy Ede\\'s wife, Ann. \\'What d\\' \\'ee means by\\n\\ncrying stale fish at that rate?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'But \\'tis a wreck. I tell \\'ee. I\\'ve azeed\\'n!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Why, so \\'tis,\\' says she, \\'and I\\'ve azeed\\'n, too; and so has every one\\n\\nwith an eye in his head.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And with that she pointed straight over my father\\'s shoulder, and he\\n\\nturned: and there, close under Dolor Point, at the end of Coverack town,\\n\\nhe saw another wreck washing, and the Point black with people, like\\n\\nemmets, running to and fro in the morning light. While we stood staring\\n\\nat her, he heard a trumpet sounded on board, the notes coming in little\\n\\njerks, like a bird rising against the wind; but faintly, of course,\\n\\nbecause of the distance and the gale blowing--though this had dropped a\\n\\nlittle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'She\\'s a transport,\\' said Billy Ede\\'s wife, Ann, \\'and full of horse\\n\\nsoldiers, fine long men. When she struck they must ha\\' pitched the\\n\\nhosses over first to lighten the ship, for a score of dead hosses had\\n\\nwashed in afore I left, half an hour back. An\\' three or four soldiers,\\n\\ntoo--fine long corpses in white breeches and jackets of blue and gold. I\\n\\nheld the lantern to one. Such a straight young man.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My father asked her about the trumpeting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'That\\'s the queerest bit of all. She was burnin\\' a light when me an\\' my\\n\\nman joined the crowd down there. All her masts had gone; whether they\\n\\nwere carried away, or were cut away to ease her, I don\\'t rightly know.\\n\\nAnyway, there she lay \\'pon the rocks with her decks bare. Her keelson\\n\\nwas broke under her and her bottom sagged and stove, and she had just\\n\\nsettled down like a sitting hen--just the leastest list to starboard;\\n\\nbut a man could stand there easy. They had rigged up ropes across her,\\n\\nfrom bulwark to bulwark, an\\' beside these the men were mustered, holding\\n\\non like grim death whenever the sea made a clean breach over them, an\\'\\n\\nstanding up like heroes as soon as it passed. The captain an\\' the\\n\\nofficers were clinging to the rail of the quarter-deck, all in their\\n\\ngolden uniforms, waiting for the end as if \\'twas King George they\\n\\nexpected. There was no way to help, for she lay right beyond cast of\\n\\nline, though our folk tried it fifty times. And beside them clung a\\n\\ntrumpeter, a whacking big man, an\\' between the heavy seas he would lift\\n\\nhis trumpet with one hand, and blow a call; and every time he blew the\\n\\nmen gave a cheer. There (she says)--hark \\'ee now--there he goes agen!\\n\\nBut you won\\'t hear no cheering any more, for few are left to cheer, and\\n\\ntheir voices weak. Bitter cold the wind is, and I reckon it numbs their\\n\\ngrip o\\' the ropes, for they were dropping off fast with every sea when\\n\\nmy man sent me home to get his breakfast. Another wreck, you say? Well,\\n\\nthere\\'s no hope for the tender dears, if \\'tis the Manacles. You\\'d better\\n\\nrun down and help yonder; though \\'tis little help that any man can give.\\n\\nNot one came in alive while I was there. The tide\\'s flowing, an\\' she\\n\\nwon\\'t hold together another hour, they say.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, sure enough, the end was coming fast when my father got down to\\n\\nthe point. Six men had been cast up alive, or just breathing--a seaman\\n\\nand five troopers. The seaman was the only one that had breath to speak;\\n\\nand while they were carrying him into the town, the word went round\\n\\nthat the ship\\'s name was the Despatch, transport, homeward bound from\\n\\nCorunna, with a detachment of the 7th Hussars, that had been fighting\\n\\nout there with Sir John Moore. The seas had rolled her farther over by\\n\\nthis time, and given her decks a pretty sharp slope; but a dozen men\\n\\nstill held on, seven by the ropes near the ship\\'s waist, a couple near\\n\\nthe break of the poop, and three on the quarter-deck. Of these three my\\n\\nfather made out one to be the skipper; close by him clung an officer in\\n\\nfull regimentals--his name, they heard after, was Captain Duncanfield;\\n\\nand last came the tall trumpeter; and if you\\'ll believe me, the fellow\\n\\nwas making shift there, at the very last, to blow _\\'God Save the King.\\'_\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, he got to _\\'Send Us Victorious\\'_ before an extra big sea\\n\\ncame bursting across and washed them off the deck--every man but one of\\n\\nthe pair beneath the poop--and _he_ dropped his hold before the next\\n\\nwave; being stunned, I reckon. The others went out of sight at once, but\\n\\nthe trumpeter--being, as I said, a powerful man as well as a tough\\n\\nswimmer--rose like a duck, rode out a couple of breakers, and came in on\\n\\nthe crest of the third. The folks looked to see him broke like an egg at\\n\\ntheir feet; but when the smother cleared, there he was, lying face\\n\\ndownward on a ledge below them; and one of the men that happened to have\\n\\na rope round him--I forget the fellow\\'s name, if I ever heard it--jumped\\n\\ndown and grabbed him by the ankle as he began to slip back. Before the\\n\\nnext big sea, the pair were hauled high enough to be out of harm, and\\n\\nanother heave brought them up to grass. Quick work; but master trumpeter\\n\\nwasn\\'t quite dead! nothing worse than a cracked head and three staved\\n\\nribs. In twenty minutes or so they had him in bed, with the doctor to\\n\\ntend him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now was the time--nothing being left alive upon the transport--for my\\n\\nfather to tell of the sloop he\\'d seen driving upon the Manacles. And\\n\\nwhen he got a hearing, though the most were set upon salvage, and\\n\\nbelieved a wreck in the hand, so to say, to be worth half a dozen they\\n\\ncouldn\\'t see, a good few volunteered to start off with him and have a\\n\\nlook. They crossed Lowland Point; no ship to be seen on the Manacles,\\n\\nnor anywhere upon the sea. One or two was for calling my father a liar.\\n\\n\\'Wait till we come to Dean Point,\\' said he. Sure enough, on the far side\\n\\nof Dean Point, they found the sloop\\'s mainmast washing about with half a\\n\\ndozen men lashed to it--men in red jackets--every mother\\'s son drowned\\n\\nand staring; and a little farther on, just under the Dean, three or\\n\\nfour bodies cast up on the shore, one of them a small drummer-boy,\\n\\nside-drum and all; and, near by, part of a ship\\'s gig, with \\'H. M. S.\\n\\nPrimrose\\' cut on the stern-board. From this point on, the shore was\\n\\nlittered thick with wreckage and dead bodies--the most of them marines\\n\\nin uniform; and in Godrevy Cove in particular, a heap of furniture from\\n\\nthe captain\\'s cabin, and among it a water-tight box, not much damaged,\\n\\nand full of papers, by which, when it came to be examined next day, the\\n\\nwreck was easily made out to be the Primrose of eighteen guns, outward\\n\\nbound from Portsmouth, with a fleet of transports for the Spanish War,\\n\\nthirty sail, I\\'ve heard, but I\\'ve never heard what became of them. Being\\n\\nhandled by merchant skippers, no doubt they rode out the gale and\\n\\nreached the Tagus safe and sound. Not but what the captain of the\\n\\nPrimrose (Mein was his name) did quite right to try and club-haul his\\n\\nvessel when he found himself under the land; only he never ought to have\\n\\ngot there if he took proper soundings. But it\\'s easy talking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The Primrose, sir, was a handsome vessel--for her size, one of the\\n\\nhandsomest in the King\\'s service--and newly fitted out at Plymouth Dock.\\n\\nSo the boys had brave pickings from her in the way of brass-work,\\n\\nship\\'s instruments, and the like, let alone some barrels of stores not\\n\\nmuch spoiled. They loaded themselves with as much as they could carry,\\n\\nand started for home, meaning to make a second journey before the\\n\\npreventive men got wind of their doings and came to spoil the fun. But\\n\\nas my father was passing back under the Dean, he happened to take a look\\n\\nover his shoulder at the bodies there. \\'Hullo,\\' says he, and dropped his\\n\\ngear, \\'I do believe there\\'s a leg moving!\\' And, running fore, he stooped\\n\\nover the small drummer-boy that I told you about. The poor little chap\\n\\nwas lying there, with his face a mass of bruises and his eyes closed:\\n\\nbut he had shifted one leg an inch or two, and was still breathing. So\\n\\nmy father pulled out a knife and cut him free from his drum--that was\\n\\nlashed on to him with a double turn of Manilla rope--and took him up and\\n\\ncarried him along here, to this very room that we\\'re sitting in. He lost\\n\\na good deal by this, for when he went back to fetch his bundle the\\n\\npreventive men had got hold of it, and were thick as thieves along the\\n\\nforeshore; so that \\'twas only by paying one or two to look the other way\\n\\nthat he picked up anything worth carrying off: which you\\'ll allow to be\\n\\nhard, seeing that he was the first man to give news of the wreck.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, the inquiry was held, of course, and my father gave evidence, and\\n\\nfor the rest they had to trust to the sloop\\'s papers, for not a soul was\\n\\nsaved besides the drummer-boy, and he was raving in a fever, brought on\\n\\nby the cold and the fright. And the seamen and the five troopers gave\\n\\nevidence about the loss of the Despatch. The tall trumpeter, too, whose\\n\\nribs were healing, came forward and kissed the book; but somehow his\\n\\nhead had been hurt in coming ashore, and he talked foolish-like, and\\n\\n\\'twas easy seen he would never be a proper man again. The others were\\n\\ntaken up to Plymouth, and so went their ways; but the trumpeter stayed\\n\\non in Coverick; and King George, finding he was fit for nothing, sent\\n\\nhim down a trifle of a pension after a while--enough to keep him in\\n\\nboard and lodging, with a bit of tobacco over.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now the first time that this man--William Tallifer, he called\\n\\nhimself--met with the drummer-boy, was about a fortnight after the\\n\\nlittle chap had bettered enough to be allowed a short walk out of doors,\\n\\nwhich he took, if you please, in full regimentals. There never was a\\n\\nsoldier so proud of his dress. His own suit had shrunk a brave bit with\\n\\nthe salt water; but into ordinary frock an\\' corduroys he declared he\\n\\nwould not get--not if he had to go naked the rest of his life; so my\\n\\nfather, being a good-natured man and handy with the needle, turned to\\n\\nand repaired damages with a piece or two of scarlet cloth cut from the\\n\\njacket of one of the drowned Marines. Well, the poor little chap chanced\\n\\nto be standing, in this rig-out, down by the gate of Gunner\\'s Meadow,\\n\\nwhere they had buried two-score and over of his comrades. The morning\\n\\nwas a fine one, early in March month; and along came the cracked\\n\\ntrumpeter, likewise taking a stroll.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Hullo!\\' says he; \\'good-mornin\\'! And what might you be doin\\' here?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'I was a-wishin\\',\\' says the boy, \\'I had a pair o\\' drumsticks. Our lads\\n\\nwere buried yonder without so much as a drum tapped or a musket fired;\\n\\nand that\\'s not Christian burial for British soldiers.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Phut!\\' says the trumpeter, and spat on the ground; \\'a parcel of\\n\\nMarines!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The boy eyed him a second or so, but answered up: \\'If I\\'d a tab of turf\\n\\nhandy, I\\'d bung it at your mouth, you greasy cavalryman, and learn you\\n\\nto speak respectful of your betters. The Marines are the handiest body\\n\\nof men in the service.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The trumpeter looked down on him from the height of six foot two, and\\n\\nasked: \\'Did they die well?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'They died very well. There was a lot of running to and fro at first,\\n\\nand some of the men began to cry, and a few to strip off their clothes.\\n\\nBut when the ship fell off for the last time, Captain Mein turned and\\n\\nsaid something to Major Griffiths, the commanding officer on board, and\\n\\nthe Major called out to me to beat to quarters. It might have been for a\\n\\nwedding, he sang it out so cheerful. We\\'d had word already that \\'twas to\\n\\nbe parade order, and the men fell in as trim and decent as if they were\\n\\ngoing to church. One or two even tried to shave at the last moment. The\\n\\nMajor wore his medals. One of the seamen, seeing that I had hard work to\\n\\nkeep the drum steady--the sling being a bit loose for me and the wind\\n\\nwhat you remember--lashed it tight with a piece of rope; and that saved\\n\\nmy life afterward, a drum being as good as a cork until it\\'s stove. I\\n\\nkept beating away until every man was on deck; and then the Major formed\\n\\nthem up and told them to die like British soldiers, and the chaplain\\n\\nread a prayer or two--the boys standin\\' all the while like rocks, each\\n\\nman\\'s courage keeping up the other\\'s. The chaplain was in the middle of\\n\\na prayer when she struck. In ten minutes she was gone. That was how they\\n\\ndied, cavalryman.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'And that was very well done, drummer of the Marines. What\\'s your\\n\\nname?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'John Christian.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Mine\\'s William George Tallifer, trumpeter, of the 7th Light\\n\\nDragoons--the Queen\\'s Own. I played _\\'God Save the King\\'_ while our men\\n\\nwere drowning. Captain Duncanfield told me to sound a call or two, to\\n\\nput them in heart; but that matter of _\\'God Save the King\\'_ was a notion\\n\\nof my own. I won\\'t say anything to hurt the feelings of a Marine, even\\n\\nif he\\'s not much over five foot tall; but the Queen\\'s Own Hussars is a\\n\\ntearin\\' fine regiment. As between horse and foot \\'tis a question o\\'\\n\\nwhich gets the chance. All the way from Sahagun to Corunna \\'twas we that\\n\\ntook and gave the knocks--at Mayorga and Rueda and Bennyventy.\\' (The\\n\\nreason, sir, I can speak the names so pat is that my father learnt \\'em\\n\\nby heart afterward from the trumpeter, who was always talking about\\n\\nMayorga and Rueda and Bennyventy.) \\'We made the rearguard, under General\\n\\nPaget, and drove the French every time; and all the infantry did was to\\n\\nsit about in wine-shops till we whipped \\'em out, an\\' steal an\\' straggle\\n\\nan\\' play the tom-fool in general. And when it came to a stand-up fight\\n\\nat Corunna, \\'twas we that had to stay sea-sick aboard the transports,\\n\\nan\\' watch the infantry in the thick o\\' the caper. Very well they\\n\\nbehaved, too; \\'specially the 4th Regiment, an\\' the 42d Highlanders, an\\'\\n\\nthe Dirty Half-Hundred. Oh, ay; they\\'re decent regiments, all three. But\\n\\nthe Queen\\'s Own Hussars is a tearin\\' fine regiment. So you played on\\n\\nyour drum when the ship was goin\\' down? Drummer John Christian, I\\'ll\\n\\nhave to get you a new pair o\\' drum-sticks for that.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, sir, it appears that the very next day the trumpeter marched into\\n\\nHelston, and got a carpenter there to turn him a pair of box-wood\\n\\ndrum-sticks for the boy. And this was the beginning of one of the most\\n\\ncurious friendships you ever heard tell of. Nothing delighted the pair\\n\\nmore than to borrow a boat of my father and pull out to the rocks where\\n\\nthe Primrose and the Despatch had struck and sunk; and on still days\\n\\n\\'twas pretty to hear them out there off the Manacles, the drummer\\n\\nplaying his tattoo--for they always took their music with them--and the\\n\\ntrumpeter practising calls, and making his trumpet speak like an angel.\\n\\nBut if the weather turned roughish, they\\'d be walking together and\\n\\ntalking; leastwise, the youngster listened while the other discoursed\\n\\nabout Sir John\\'s campaign in Spain and Portugal, telling how each little\\n\\nskirmish befell; and of Sir John himself, and General Baird and General\\n\\nPaget, and Colonel Vivian his own commanding officer, and what kind men\\n\\nthey were; and of the last bloody stand-up at Corunna, and so forth, as\\n\\nif neither could have enough.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But all this had to come to an end in the late summer, for the boy,\\n\\nJohn Christian, being now well and strong again, must go up to Plymouth\\n\\nto report himself. \\'Twas his own wish (for I believe King George had\\n\\nforgotten all about him), but his friend wouldn\\'t hold him back. As for\\n\\nthe trumpeter, my father had made an arrangement to take him on as a\\n\\nlodger as soon as the boy left; and on the morning fixed for the start\\n\\nhe was up at the door here by five o\\'clock, with his trumpet slung by\\n\\nhis side, and all the rest of his belongings in a small valise. A Monday\\n\\nmorning it was, and after breakfast he had fixed to walk with the boy\\n\\nsome way on the road toward Helston, where the coach started. My father\\n\\nleft them at breakfast together, and went out to meat the pig, and do a\\n\\nfew odd morning jobs of that sort. When he came back, the boy was still\\n\\nat table, and the trumpeter standing here by the chimney-place with the\\n\\ndrum and trumpet in his hands, hitched together just as they be at this\\n\\nmoment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Look at this,\\' he says to my father, showing him the lock; \\'I picked\\n\\nit up off a starving brass-worker in Lisbon, and it is not one of your\\n\\ncommon locks that one word of six letters will open at any time. There\\'s\\n\\n_janius_ in this lock; for you\\'ve only to make the ring spell any\\n\\nsix-letter word you please, and snap down the lock upon that, and never\\n\\na soul can open it--not the maker, even--until somebody comes along that\\n\\nknows the word you snapped it on. Now, Johnny, here\\'s goin\\', and he\\n\\nleaves his drum behind him; for, though he can make pretty music on it,\\n\\nthe parchment sags in wet weather, by reason of the sea-water getting at\\n\\nit; an\\' if he carries it to Plymouth, they\\'ll only condemn it and give\\n\\nhim another. And as for me, I shan\\'t have the heart to put lip to the\\n\\ntrumpet any more when Johnny\\'s gone. So we\\'ve chosen a word together,\\n\\nand locked \\'em together upon that; and, by your leave, I\\'ll hang \\'em\\n\\nhere together on the hook over your fireplace. Maybe Johnny\\'ll come\\n\\nback; maybe not. Maybe, if he comes, I\\'ll be dead an\\' gone, an\\' he\\'ll\\n\\ntake \\'em apart an\\' try their music for old sake\\'s sake. But if he never\\n\\ncomes, nobody can separate \\'em; for nobody besides knows the word. And\\n\\nif you marry and have sons, you can tell \\'em that here are tied together\\n\\nthe souls of Johnny Christian, drummer, of the Marines, and William\\n\\nGeorge Tallifer, once trumpeter of the Queen\\'s Own Hussars. Amen.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"With that he hung the two instruments \\'pon the hook there; and the boy\\n\\nstood up and thanked my father and shook hands; and the pair went forth\\n\\nof the door, toward Helston.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Somewhere on the road they took leave of one another; but nobody saw\\n\\nthe parting, nor heard what was said between them. About three in the\\n\\nafternoon the trumpeter came walking back over the hill; and by the time\\n\\nmy father came home from the fishing, the cottage was tidied up and the\\n\\ntea ready, and the whole place shining like a new pin. From that time\\n\\nfor five years he lodged here with my father, looking after the house\\n\\nand tilling the garden; and all the while he was steadily failing, the\\n\\nhurt in his head spreading, in a manner, to his limbs. My father watched\\n\\nthe feebleness growing on him, but said nothing. And from first to last\\n\\nneither spake a word about the drummer, John Christian; nor did any\\n\\nletter reach them, nor word of his doings.\\n\\n\\n\\n     \"The rest of the tale you\\'m free to believe, sir, or not, as you\\n\\n     please. It stands upon my father\\'s words, and he always declared he\\n\\n     was ready to kiss the Book upon it before judge and jury. He said,\\n\\n     too, that he never had the wit to make up such a yarn; and he\\n\\n     defied any one to explain about the lock, in particular, by any\\n\\n     other tale. But you shall judge for yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My father said that about three o\\'clock in the morning, April\\n\\nfourteenth of the year \\'fourteen, he and William Tallifer were sitting\\n\\nhere, just as you and I, sir, are sitting now. My father had put on his\\n\\nclothes a few minutes before, and was mending his spiller by the light\\n\\nof the horn lantern, meaning to set off before daylight to haul the\\n\\ntrammel. The trumpeter hadn\\'t been to bed at all. Toward the last he\\n\\nmostly spent his nights (and his days, too) dozing in the elbow-chair\\n\\nwhere you sit at this minute. He was dozing then (my father said), with\\n\\nhis chin dropped forward on his chest, when a knock sounded upon the\\n\\ndoor, and the door opened, and in walked an upright young man in scarlet\\n\\nregimentals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He had grown a brave bit, and his face was the color of wood-ashes; but\\n\\nit was the drummer, John Christian. Only his uniform was different from\\n\\nthe one he used to wear, and the figures \\'38\\' shone in brass upon his\\n\\ncollar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The drummer walked past my father as if he never saw him, and stood by\\n\\nthe elbow-chair and said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Trumpeter, trumpeter, are you one with me?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And the trumpeter just lifted the lids of his eyes, and answered, \\'How\\n\\nshould I not be one with you, drummer Johnny--Johnny boy? The men are\\n\\npatient. \\'Til you come, I count; you march, I mark time until the\\n\\ndischarge comes.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'The discharge has come to-night,\\' said the drummer, \\'and the word is\\n\\nCorunna no longer;\\' and stepping to the chimney-place, he unhooked the\\n\\ndrum and trumpet, and began to twist the brass rings of the lock,\\n\\nspelling the word aloud, so--C-O-R-U-N-A. When he had fixed the last\\n\\nletter, the padlock opened in his hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Did you know, trumpeter, that when I came to Plymouth they put me into\\n\\na line regiment.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'The 38th is a good regiment,\\' answered the old Hussar, still in his\\n\\ndull voice. \\'I went back with them from Sahagun to Corunna. At Corunna\\n\\nthey stood in General Fraser\\'s division, on the right. They behaved\\n\\nwell.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'But I\\'d fain see the Marines again,\\' says the drummer, handing him the\\n\\ntrumpet, \\'and you--you shall call once more for the Queen\\'s Own.\\n\\nMatthew,\\' he says, suddenly, turning on my father--and when he turned,\\n\\nmy father saw for the first time that his scarlet jacket had a round\\n\\nhole by the breast-bone, and that the blood was welling there--\\'Matthew,\\n\\nwe shall want your boat.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then my father rose on his legs like a man in a dream, while they two\\n\\nslung on, the one his drum, and t\\'other his trumpet. He took the\\n\\nlantern, and went quaking before them down to the shore, and they\\n\\nbreathed heavily behind him; and they stepped into his boat, and my\\n\\nfather pushed off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Row you first for Dolor Point,\\' says the drummer. So my father rowed\\n\\nthem out past the white houses of Coverack to Dolor Point, and there, at\\n\\na word, lay on his oars. And the trumpeter, William Tallifer, put his\\n\\ntrumpet to his mouth and sounded the _Revelly_. The music of it was like\\n\\nrivers running.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'They will follow,\\' said the drummer. \\'Matthew, pull you now for the\\n\\nManacles.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So my father pulled for the Manacles, and came to an easy close outside\\n\\nCarn du. And the drummer took his sticks and beat a tattoo, there by the\\n\\nedge of the reef; and the music of it was like a rolling chariot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'That will do,\\' says he, breaking off; \\'they will follow. Pull now for\\n\\nthe shore under Gunner\\'s Meadow.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then my father pulled for the shore, and ran his boat in under Gunner\\'s\\n\\nMeadow. And they stepped out, all three, and walked up to the meadow. By\\n\\nthe gate the drummer halted and began his tattoo again, looking out\\n\\ntoward the darkness over the sea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And while the drum beat, and my father held his breath, there came up\\n\\nout of the sea and the darkness a troop of many men, horse and foot, and\\n\\nformed up among the graves; and others rose out of the graves and formed\\n\\nup--drowned Marines with bleached faces, and pale Hussars riding their\\n\\nhorses, all lean and shadowy. There was no clatter of hoofs or\\n\\naccoutrements, my father said, but a soft sound all the while, like the\\n\\nbeating of a bird\\'s wing and a black shadow lying like a pool about the\\n\\nfeet of all. The drummer stood upon a little knoll just inside the gate,\\n\\nand beside him the tall trumpeter, with hand on hip, watching them\\n\\ngather; and behind them both my father, clinging to the gate. When no\\n\\nmore came the drummer stopped playing, and said, \\'Call the roll.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then the trumpeter stepped toward the end man of the rank and called,\\n\\n\\'Troop-Sergeant-Major Thomas Irons,\\' and the man in a thin voice\\n\\nanswered, \\'Here!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Troop-Sergeant-Major Thomas Irons, how is it with you?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The man answered, \\'How should it be with me? When I was young, I\\n\\nbetrayed a girl; and when I was grown, I betrayed a friend, and for\\n\\nthese things I must pay. But I died as a man ought. God save the King!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The trumpeter called to the next man, \\'Trooper Henry Buckingham\\', and\\n\\nthe next man answered, \\'Here!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Trooper Henry Buckingham, how is it with you?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'How should it be with me? I was a drunkard, and I stole, and in Lugo,\\n\\nin a wine-shop, I knifed a man. But I died as a man should. God save the\\n\\nKing!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So the trumpeter went down the line; and when he had finished, the\\n\\ndrummer took it up, hailing the dead Marines in their order. Each man\\n\\nanswered to his name, and each man ended with \\'God save the King!\\' When\\n\\nall were hailed, the drummer stepped back to his mound, and called:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'It is well. You are content, and we are content to join you. Wait yet\\n\\na little while.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"With this he turned and ordered my father to pick up the lantern, and\\n\\nlead the way back. As my father picked it up, he heard the ranks of\\n\\ndead men cheer and call, \\'God save the King!\\' all together, and saw them\\n\\nwaver and fade back into the dark, like a breath fading off a pane.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But when they came back here to the kitchen, and my father set the\\n\\nlantern down, it seemed they\\'d both forgot about him. For the drummer\\n\\nturned in the lantern-light--and my father could see the blood still\\n\\nwelling out of the hole in his breast--and took the trumpet-sling from\\n\\naround the other\\'s neck, and locked drum and trumpet together again,\\n\\nchoosing the letters on the lock very carefully. While he did this he\\n\\nsaid:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'The word is no more Corunna, but Bayonne. As you left out an \"n\" in\\n\\nCorunna, so must I leave out an \"n\" in Bayonne.\\' And before snapping the\\n\\npadlock, he spelt out the word slowly--\\'B-A-Y-O-N-E.\\' After that, he\\n\\nused no more speech; but turned and hung the two instruments back on the\\n\\nhook; and then took the trumpeter by the arm; and the pair walked out\\n\\ninto the darkness, glancing neither to right nor left.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My father was on the point of following, when he heard a sort of sigh\\n\\nbehind him; and there, sitting in the elbow-chair, was the very\\n\\ntrumpeter he had just seen walk out by the door! If my father\\'s heart\\n\\njumped before, you may believe it jumped quicker now. But after a bit,\\n\\nhe went up to the man asleep in the chair, and put a hand upon him. It\\n\\nwas the trumpeter in flesh and blood that he touched; but though the\\n\\nflesh was warm, the trumpeter was dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, sir, they buried him three days after; and at first my father was\\n\\nminded to say nothing about his dream (as he thought it). But the day\\n\\nafter the funeral, he met Parson Kendall coming from Helston market: and\\n\\nthe parson called out: \\'Have \\'ee heard the news the coach brought down\\n\\nthis mornin\\'?\\' \\'What news?\\' says my father. \\'Why, that peace is agreed\\n\\nupon.\\' \\'None too soon,\\' says my father. \\'Not soon enough for our poor\\n\\nlads at Bayonne,\\' the parson answered. \\'Bayonne!\\' cries my father, with\\n\\na jump. \\'Why, yes;\\' and the parson told him all about a great sally the\\n\\nFrench had made on the night of April 13th. \\'Do you happen to know if\\n\\nthe 38th Regiment was engaged?\\' my father asked. \\'Come, now,\\' said\\n\\nParson Kendall, \\'I didn\\'t know you was so well up in the campaign. But,\\n\\nas it happens, I _do_ know that the 38th was engaged, for \\'twas they\\n\\nthat held a cottage and stopped the French advance.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Still my father held his tongue; and when, a week later, he walked into\\n\\nHelston and bought a _Mercury_ off the Sherborne rider, and got the\\n\\nlandlord of the Angel to spell out the list of killed and wounded, sure\\n\\nenough, there among the killed was Drummer John Christian, of the 38th\\n\\nFoot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"After this there was nothing for a religious man but to make a clean\\n\\nbreast. So my father went up to Parson Kendall and told the whole story.\\n\\nThe parson listened, and put a question or two, and then asked:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Have you tried to open the lock since that night?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'I han\\'t dared to touch it,\\' says my father.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Then come along and try.\\' When the parson came to the cottage here, he\\n\\ntook the things off the hook and tried the lock. \\'Did he say\\n\\n_\"Bayonne\"?_ The word has seven letters.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Not if you spell it with one \"n\" as _he_ did,\\' says my father.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The parson spelt it out--B-A-Y-O-N-E. \\'Whew!\\' says he, for the lock had\\n\\nfallen open in his hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He stood considering it a moment, and then he said, \\'I tell you what. I\\n\\nshouldn\\'t blab this all round the parish, if I was you. You won\\'t get no\\n\\ncredit for truth-telling, and a miracle\\'s wasted on a set of fools. But\\n\\nif you like, I\\'ll shut down the lock again upon a holy word that no one\\n\\nbut me shall know, and neither drummer nor trumpeter, dead nor alive,\\n\\nshall frighten the secret out of me.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'I wish to gracious you would, parson,\\' said my father.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The parson chose the holy word there and then, and shut the lock back\\n\\nupon it, and hung the drum and trumpet back in their place. He is gone\\n\\nlong since, taking the word with him. And till the lock is broken by\\n\\nforce, nobody will ever separate those twain.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: HOW JAN BREWER WAS PISKEY-LADEN]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 19: From _The Wandering Heath,_ by Arthur Quiller-Couch.\\n\\nCopyright, 1895, by Charles Scribner\\'s Sons. By permission of the\\n\\npublishers.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW JAN BREWER WAS PISKEY-LADEN[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE moon was near her setting as a tall, broad-shouldered man called\\n\\nJan Brewer was walking home to Constantine Bay to his cottage on the\\n\\nedge of the cliff.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was singing an old song to himself as he went along, and he sang till\\n\\nhe drew near the ruins of Constantine Church, standing on a sandy common\\n\\nnear the bay. As he drew near the remains of this ancient church, which\\n\\nwere clearly seen in the moonshine, he thought he heard some one\\n\\nlaughing, but he was not quite sure, for the sea was roaring on the\\n\\nbeach below the common, and the waves were making a loud noise as they\\n\\ndashed up the great headland of Trevose.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I was mistaken; \\'twas nobody laughing,\" said Jan to himself, and he\\n\\nwalked on again, singing as before; and he sang till he came near a\\n\\ngate, which opened into a field leading to his cottage, but when he got\\n\\nthere he could not see the gate or the gateway.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I was so taken up with singing the old song, that I must have missed my\\n\\nway,\" he said again to himself. \"I\\'ll go back to the head of the common\\n\\nand start afresh,\" which he did; and when he got to the place where his\\n\\ngate ought to have been, he could not find it to save his life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I must be clean _mazed_,\"[21] he cried. \"I have never got out of my\\n\\nreckoning before, nor missed finding my way to our gate, even when the\\n\\nnight has been as dark as pitch. It isn\\'t at all dark to-night; I can\\n\\nsee Trevose Head--and yet I can\\'t see my own little gate! But I en\\'t\\n\\na-going to be done; I\\'ll go round and round this common till I _do_ find\\n\\nmy gate.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd round and round the common he went, but find his gate he could not.\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery time he passed the ruins of the church a laugh came up from the\\n\\npool below the ruins, and once he thought he saw a dancing light on the\\n\\nedge of the pool, where a lot of reeds and rushes were growing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The Little Man in the Lantern is about to-night,\"[22] he said to\\n\\nhimself, as he glanced at the pool. \"But I never knew he was given to\\n\\nlaughing before.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce more he went round the common, and when he had passed the ruins he\\n\\nheard giggling and laughing, this time quite close to him; and looking\\n\\ndown on the grass, he saw to his astonishment hundreds of Little Men and\\n\\nLittle Women with tiny lights in their hands, which they were\\n\\n_flinking_[23] about as they laughed and giggled.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Little Men wore stocking-caps, the color of ripe briar berries, and\\n\\ngrass-green coats, and the Little Women had on old grandmother cloaks of\\n\\nthe same vivid hue as the Wee Men\\'s coats, and they also wore little\\n\\nscarlet hoods.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I believe the great big chap sees us,\" said one of the Little Men,\\n\\ncatching sight of Jan\\'s astonished face. \"He must be Piskey-eyed, and we\\n\\ndid not know it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is he really?\" cried one of the _Dinky_[24] Women. \"\\'Tis a pity, but\\n\\nwe\\'ll have our game over him just the same.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That we will,\" cried all the Little Men and Little Women in one voice;\\n\\nand, forming a ring round the great tall fellow, they began to dance\\n\\nround him, laughing, giggling and flashing up their lights as they\\n\\ndanced.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey went round him so fast that poor Jan was quite bewildered, and\\n\\nwhichever way he looked there were these Little Men and Little Women\\n\\ngiggling up into his bearded face. And when he tried to break through\\n\\ntheir ring they went before him and behind him, making a game over him.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was at their mercy and they knew it; and when they saw the great\\n\\nfellow\\'s misery, they only laughed and giggled the more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got him!\" they cried to each other, and they said it with such\\n\\ngusto and with such a comical expression on their tiny brown faces, that\\n\\nJan, bewildered as he was, and tired with going round the common so many\\n\\ntimes, could not help laughing, they looked so very funny, particularly\\n\\nwhen the Little Women winked up at him from under their little scarlet\\n\\nhoods.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Piskeys--for they were Piskeys[25]--hurried him down the common,\\n\\ndancing round him all the time; and when he got there he felt so\\n\\nmizzy-mazey with those tiny whirling figures going round and round him\\n\\nlike a whirligig, that he did not know whether he was standing on his\\n\\nhead or his heels. He was also in a bath of perspiration--\"sweating\\n\\nleaking,\" he said--and, putting his hand in his pocket to take out a\\n\\nhandkerchief to mop his face, he remembered having been told that, if\\n\\nhe ever got Piskey-laden, he must turn his coat pockets inside out,\\n\\nthen he would be free at once from his Piskey tormentors. And\\n\\nin a minute or less his coat-pockets were hanging out, and all the\\n\\nLittle Men and the Little Women had vanished, and there, right in front\\n\\nof him, he saw his own gate! He lost no time in opening it, and in a\\n\\nvery short time was in his thatched cottage on the cliff.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: MY GRANDFATHER, HENDRY WATTY]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 20: From _Legends and Tales of North Cornwall_, by Enys\\n\\nTregarthen.

I don\\'t\\n\\nmind telling you about it. \\'Tis a curious tale, too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy grandfather, Hendry Watty, bet four gallons of eggy-hot that he would\\n\\nrow out to the Shivering Grounds, all in the dead waste of the night,\\n\\nand haul a trammel there. To find the Shivering Grounds by night, you\\n\\nget the Gull Rock in a line with Tregamenna and pull out till you open\\n\\nthe light on St. Anthony\\'s Point; but everybody gives the place a wide\\n\\nberth because Archelaus Rowett\\'s lugger foundered there one time, with\\n\\nsix hands on board; and they say that at night you can hear the drowned\\n\\nmen hailing their names. But my grandfather was the boldest man in Port\\n\\nLoe, and said he didn\\'t care. So one Christmas Eve by daylight he and\\n\\nhis mates went out and tilled the trammel; and then they came back and\\n\\nspent the forepart of the evening over the eggy-hot, down to Oliver\\'s\\n\\ntiddly-wink,[27] to keep my grandfather\\'s spirits up and also to show\\n\\nthat the bet was made in earnest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Twas past eleven o\\'clock when they left Oliver\\'s and walked down to the\\n\\ncove to see my grandfather off. He has told me since that he didn\\'t feel\\n\\nafraid at all, but very friendly in mind, especially toward William John\\n\\nDunn, who was walking on his right hand. This puzzled him at the first,\\n\\nfor as a rule he didn\\'t think much of William John Dunn. But now he\\n\\nshook hands with him several times, and just as he was stepping into the\\n\\nboat he says, \"You\\'ll take care of Mary Polly while I\\'m away.\" Mary\\n\\nPolly Polsue was my grandfather\\'s sweetheart at that time. But why my\\n\\ngrandfather should have spoken as if he was bound on a long voyage he\\n\\nnever could tell; he used to set it down to fate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I will,\" said William John Dunn; and then they gave a cheer and pushed\\n\\nmy grandfather off, and he lit his pipe and away he rowed all into the\\n\\ndead waste of the night. He rowed and rowed, all in the dead waste the\\n\\nnight; and he got the Gull Rock in a line with Tregamenna windows; and\\n\\nstill he was rowing, when to his great surprise he heard a voice\\n\\ncalling:\\n\\n\\n\\n    _\"Hendry Watty! Hendry Watty!\"_\\n\\n\\n\\nI told you my grandfather was the boldest man in Port Loe. But he\\n\\ndropped his two oars now, and made the five signs of Penitence. For who\\n\\ncould it be calling him out here in the dead waste and middle of the\\n\\nnight?\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"HENDRY WATTY! HENDRY WATTY! _drop\\n\\n    me a line_.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMy grandfather kept his fishing-lines in a little skivet under the\\n\\nstern-sheets. But not a trace of bait had he on board. If he had, he was\\n\\ntoo much a-tremble to bait a hook.\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"HENDRY WATTY! HENDRY WATTY! _drop\\n\\n    me a line, or I\\'ll know why_.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMy poor grandfather had by this picked up his oars again, and was rowing\\n\\nlike mad to get quit of the neighborhood, when something or somebody\\n\\ngave three knocks--_thump, thump, thump!_--on the bottom of the boat,\\n\\njust as you would knock on a door.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe third thump fetched Hendry Watty upright on his legs. He had no\\n\\nmore heart for disobeying, but having bitten his pipe-stem in half by\\n\\nthis time--his teeth chattered so--he baited his hook with the broken\\n\\nbit and flung it overboard, letting the line run out in the stern-notch.\\n\\nNot half-way had it run before he felt a long pull on it, like the\\n\\nsucking of a dog-fish.\\n\\n\\n\\n    _\"Hendry Watty! Hendry Watty! pull me in.\"_\\n\\n\\n\\nHendry Watty pulled in hand over fist, and in came the lead sinker over\\n\\nthe notch, and still the line was heavy; he pulled and he pulled, and\\n\\nnext, all out of the dead waste of the night, came two white hands, like\\n\\na washerwoman\\'s, and gripped hold of the stern-board; and on the left of\\n\\nthese two hands, was a silver ring, sunk very deep in the flesh. If this\\n\\nwas bad, worse was the face that followed--and if this was bad for\\n\\nanybody, it was worse for my grandfather who had known Archelaus Rowett\\n\\nbefore he was drowned out on the Shivering Grounds, six years before.\\n\\n\\n\\nArchelaus Rowett climbed in over the stern, pulled the hook with the bit\\n\\nof pipe-stem out of his cheek, sat down in the stern-sheets, shook a\\n\\nsmall crayfish out of his whiskers, and said very coolly: \"If you should\\n\\ncome across my wife--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThat was all that my grandfather stayed to hear. At the sound of\\n\\nArchelaus\\'s voice he fetched a yell, jumped clean over the side of the\\n\\nboat and swam for dear life. He swam and swam, till by the bit of the\\n\\nmoon he saw the Gull Rock close ahead. There were lashin\\'s of rats on\\n\\nthe Gull Rock, as he knew; but he was a good deal surprised at the way\\n\\nthey were behaving, for they sat in a row at the water\\'s edge and\\n\\nfished, with their tails let down into the sea for fishing-lines; and\\n\\ntheir eyes were like garnets burning as they looked at my grandfather\\n\\nover their shoulders.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hendry Watty! Hendry Watty! you can\\'t land here--you\\'re disturbing the\\n\\npollack.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bejimbers! I wouldn\\' do that for the world,\" says my grandfather; so\\n\\noff he pushes and swims for the mainland. This was a long job, and it\\n\\nwas as much as he could do to reach Kibberick beach, where he fell on\\n\\nhis face and hands among the stones, and there lay, taking breath.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe breath was hardly back in his body before he heard footsteps, and\\n\\nalong the beach came a woman, and passed close by to him. He lay very\\n\\nquiet, and as she came near he saw \\'twas Sarah Rowett, that used to be\\n\\nArchelaus\\'s wife, but had married another man since. She was knitting as\\n\\nshe went by, and did not seem to notice my grandfather; but he heard her\\n\\nsay to herself, \"The hour is come, and the man is come.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had scarcely begun to wonder over this when he spied a ball of\\n\\nworsted yarn beside him that Sarah had dropped. \\'Twas the ball she was\\n\\nknitting from, and a line of worsted stretched after her along the\\n\\nbeach. Hendry Watty picked up the ball and followed the thread on\\n\\ntiptoe. In less than a minute he came near enough to watch what she was\\n\\ndoing; and what she did was worth watching. First she gathered wreckwood\\n\\nand straw, and struck flint over touchwood and teened a fire. Then she\\n\\nunraveled her knitting; twisted her end of the yarn between finger and\\n\\nthumb--like a cobbler twisting a wax-end--and cast the end up towards\\n\\nthe sky. It made Hendry Watty stare when the thread, instead of falling\\n\\nback to the ground, remained hanging, just as if \\'twas fastened to\\n\\nsomething up above; but it made him stare still more when Sarah Rowett\\n\\nbegan to climb up it, and away up till nothing could be seen of her but\\n\\nher ankles dangling out of the dead waste and middle of the night.\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"HENDRY WATTY! HENDRY WATTY!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t Sarah calling, but a voice far away out to sea.\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"HENDRY WATTY! HENDRY WATTY! _send\\n\\n    me a line!\"_\\n\\n\\n\\nMy grandfather was wondering what to do, when Sarah speaks down very\\n\\nsharp to him, out of the dark:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hendry Watty! where\\'s the rocket apparatus? Can\\'t you hear the poor\\n\\nfellow asking for a line?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I do,\" says my grandfather, who was beginning to lose his temper; \"and\\n\\ndo you think, ma\\'am, that I carry a Boxer\\'s rocket in my trousers\\n\\npocket?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think you have a ball of worsted in your hand,\" says she. \"Throw it\\n\\nas far as you can.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo my grandfather threw the ball out into the dead waste and middle of\\n\\nthe night. He didn\\'t see where it pitched, or how far it went.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Right it is,\" says the woman aloft. \"\\'Tis easy seen you\\'re a hurler.\\n\\nBut what shall us do for a cradle?[28] Hendry Watty! Hendry Watty!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ma\\'am to _you,\"_ said my grandfather.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If you have the common feelings of a gentleman, I\\'ll ask you to turn\\n\\nyour back; I\\'m going to take off my stocking.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo my grandfather stared the other way very politely; and when he was\\n\\ntold he might look again, he saw she had tied the stocking to the line\\n\\nand was running it out like a cradle into the dead waste of the night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hendry Watty! Hendry Watty! look out below!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore he could answer, plump! a man\\'s leg came tumbling past his ear\\n\\nand scattered the ashes right and left.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hendry Watty! Hendry Watty! look out below!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThis time \\'twas a great white arm and hand, with a silver ring sunk\\n\\ntight in the flesh of the little finger.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hendry Watty! Hendry Watty! warm them limbs!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMy grandfather picked them up and was warming them before the fire, when\\n\\ndown came tumbling a great round head and bounced twice and lay in the\\n\\nfirelight, staring up at him. And whose head was it but Archelaus\\n\\nRowett\\'s, that he\\'d run away from once already that night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hendry Watty! Hendry Watty! look out below!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThis time \\'twas another leg, and my grandfather was just about to lay\\n\\nhands on it, when the woman called down:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hendry Watty! catch it quick! It\\'s my own leg I\\'ve thrown down by\\n\\nmistake.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe leg struck the ground and bounced high, and Hendry Watty made a leap\\n\\nafter it.\\n\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I reckon it\\'s asleep he must have been; for what he caught was not\\n\\nMrs. Rowett\\'s leg, but the jib-boom of a deep-laden brigantine that was\\n\\nrunning him down in the dark. And as he sprang for it, his boat was\\n\\ncrushed by the brigantine\\'s fore-foot and went down under his very\\n\\nboot-soles. At the same time he let out a yell, and two or three of the\\n\\ncrew ran forward and hoisted him up to the bowsprit and in on deck, safe\\n\\nand sound.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the brigantine happened to be outward bound for the River Plate; so\\n\\nthat, with one thing and another, \\'twas eleven good months before my\\n\\ngrandfather landed again at Port Loe. And who should be the first man he\\n\\nsees standing above the cove but William John Dunn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m very glad to see you,\" says William John Dunn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thank you kindly,\" answers my grandfather; \"and how\\'s Mary Polly?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, as for that,\" he says, \"she took so much looking after, that I\\n\\ncouldn\\'t feel I was properly keeping her under my eye till I married\\n\\nher, last June month.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You was always one to over-do things,\" said my grandfather.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But if you was alive an\\' well, why didn\\' you drop us a line?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNow when it came to talk about \"dropping a line,\" my grandfather fairly\\n\\nlost his temper. So he struck William John Dunn on the nose--a thing he\\n\\nhad never been known to do before--and William John Dunn hit him back,\\n\\nand the neighbors had to separate them. And next day, William John Dunn\\n\\ntook out a summons against him. Well, the case was tried before the\\n\\nmagistrates: and my grandfather told his story from the beginning, quite\\n\\nstraightforward, just as I\\'ve told it to you. And the magistrates\\n\\ndecided that, taking one thing and another, he\\'d had a great deal of\\n\\nprovocation, and fined him five shillings. And there the matter ended.\\n\\nBut now you know the reason why I\\'m William John Dunn\\'s grandson instead\\n\\nof Hendry Watty\\'s.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: CHILDE ROWLAND]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 26: From _The Wandering Heath_, by Arthur Quiller-Couch;\\n\\nCopyright, 1895, by Charles Scribner\\'s Sons.

She is now in the Dark Tower of the King of Elfland; it\\n\\nwould take the boldest knight in Christendom to bring her back.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If it is possible to bring her back,\" said her brother, \"I\\'ll do it, or\\n\\nperish in the attempt.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Possible it is,\" said the Warlock Merlin, \"but woe to the man or\\n\\nmother\\'s son that attempts it, if he is not well taught beforehand what\\n\\nhe is to do.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe eldest brother of Burd Ellen was not to be put off, by any fear of\\n\\ndanger, from attempting to get her back, so he begged the Warlock Merlin\\n\\nto tell him what he should do, and what he should not do, in going to\\n\\nseek his sister. And after he had been taught, and had repeated his\\n\\nlesson, he set out for Elfland.\\n\\n\\n\\n    But long they waited, and longer still,\\n\\n      With doubt and muckle pain,\\n\\n    But woe were the hearts of his brethren,\\n\\n      For he came not back again.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the second brother got tired and tired of waiting, and he went to\\n\\nthe Warlock Merlin and asked him the same as his brother. So he set out\\n\\nto find Burd Ellen.\\n\\n\\n\\n    But long they waited, and longer still,\\n\\n      With muckle doubt and pain,\\n\\n    And woe were his mother\\'s and brother\\'s heart,\\n\\n      For he came not back again.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd when they had waited and waited a good long time, Childe Rowland,\\n\\nthe youngest of Burd Ellen\\'s brothers, wished to go, and went to his\\n\\nmother, the good queen, to ask her to let him go. But she would not at\\n\\nfirst, for he was the last and dearest of her children, and if he was\\n\\nlost, all would be lost. But he begged, and he begged, till at last the\\n\\ngood queen let him go, and gave him his father\\'s good brand that never\\n\\nstruck in vain, and as she girt it round his waist, she said the spell\\n\\nthat would give it victory.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Childe Rowland said good-by to the good queen, his mother, and went\\n\\nto the cave of the Warlock Merlin. \"Once more, and but once more,\" he\\n\\nsaid to the Warlock, \"tell how man or mother\\'s son may rescue Burd Ellen\\n\\nand her brothers twain.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, my son,\" said the Warlock Merlin, \"there are but two things,\\n\\nsimple they may seem, but hard they are to do. One thing to do, and one\\n\\nthing not to do. And the thing to do is this: after you have entered the\\n\\nland of Fairy, whoever speaks to you, till you meet the Burd Ellen, you\\n\\nmust out with your father\\'s brand and off with their head. And what\\n\\nyou\\'ve not to do is this: bite no bit, and drink no drop, however hungry\\n\\nor thirsty you be; drink a drop or bite a bit, while in Elfland you be\\n\\nand never will you see Middle Earth again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Childe Rowland said the two things over and over again, till he knew\\n\\nthem by heart, and he thanked the Warlock Merlin and went on his way.\\n\\nAnd he went along, and along, and along, and still further along, till\\n\\nhe came to the horse-herd of the King of Elfland feeding his horses.\\n\\nThese he knew by their fiery eyes, and knew that he was at last in the\\n\\nland of Fairy. \"Canst thou tell me,\" said Childe Rowland to the\\n\\nhorse-herd, \"where the King of Elfland\\'s Dark Tower is?\" \"I cannot tell\\n\\nthee,\" said the horse-herd, \"but go on a little further and thou wilt\\n\\ncome to the cow-herd, and he, maybe, can tell thee.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, without a word more, Childe Rowland drew the good brand that never\\n\\nstruck in vain, and off went the horse-herd\\'s head, and Childe Rowland\\n\\nwent on further, till he came to the cow-herd, and asked him the same\\n\\nquestion. \"I can\\'t tell thee,\" said he, \"but go on a little further, and\\n\\nthou wilt come to the hen-wife, and she is sure to know.\" Then Childe\\n\\nRowland out with his good brand, that never struck in vain, and off went\\n\\nthe cow-herd\\'s head. And he went on a little further, till he came to an\\n\\nold woman in a gray cloak, and he asked her if she knew where the Dark\\n\\nTower of the King of Elfland was. \"Go on a little further,\" said the\\n\\nhen-wife, \"till you come to a round green hill, surrounded with\\n\\nterrace-rings, from the bottom to the top; go round it three times,\\n\\n\\'widershins,\\' and each time say:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"\\'Open, door! open, door!\\n\\n    And let me come in,\\'\\n\\n\\n\\nand the third time the door will open, and you may go in.\" And Childe\\n\\nRowland was just going on, when he remembered what he had to do; so he\\n\\nout with the good brand, that never struck in vain, and off went the\\n\\nhen-wife\\'s head.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he went on, and on, and on, till he came to the round green hill\\n\\nwith the terrace-rings from top to bottom, and he went round it three\\n\\ntimes, \"widershins,\" saying each time:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Open, door! open, door!\\n\\n    And let me come in.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the third time the door did open, and he went in, and it closed with\\n\\na click, and Childe Rowland was left in the dark.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was not exactly dark, but a kind of twilight or gloaming. There were\\n\\nneither windows nor candles, and he could not make out where the\\n\\ntwilight came from, if not through the walls and roof. There were rough\\n\\narches made of a transparent rock, incrusted with sheepsilver and rock\\n\\nspar, and other bright stones. But though it was rock, the air was quite\\n\\nwarm, as it always is in Elfland. So he went through this passage till\\n\\nat last he came to two wide and high folding-doors which stood ajar. And\\n\\nwhen he opened them, there he saw a most wonderful and glorious sight. A\\n\\nlarge and spacious hall, so large that it seemed to be as long, and as\\n\\nbroad, as the green hill itself. The roof was supported by fine pillars,\\n\\nso large and lofty, that the pillars of a cathedral were as nothing to\\n\\nthem. They were all of gold and silver, with fretted work, and between\\n\\nthem and around them wreaths of flowers, composed of what do you think?\\n\\nWhy, of diamonds and emeralds, and all manner of precious stones. And\\n\\nthe very key-stones of the arches had for ornaments clusters of diamonds\\n\\nand rubies, and pearls, and other precious stones. And all these arches\\n\\nmet in the middle of the roof, and just there, hung by a gold chain, an\\n\\nimmense lamp made out of one big pearl hollowed out and quite\\n\\ntransparent. And in the middle of this was a big, huge carbuncle, which\\n\\nkept spinning round and round, and this was what gave light by its rays\\n\\nto the whole hall, which seemed as if the setting sun was shining on it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe hall was furnished in a manner equally grand, and at one end of it\\n\\nwas a glorious couch of velvet, silk and gold, and there sat Burd Ellen,\\n\\ncombing her golden hair with a silver comb. And when she saw Childe\\n\\nRowland she stood up and said:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"God pity ye, poor luckless fool,\\n\\n      What have ye here to do?\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Hear ye this, my youngest brother,\\n\\n      Why didn\\'t ye bide at home?\\n\\n    Had you a hundred thousand lives\\n\\n      Ye couldn\\'t spare any a one.\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"But sit ye down; but woe, O, woe,\\n\\n      That ever ye were born,\\n\\n    For come the King of Elfland in,\\n\\n      Your fortune is forlorn.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen they sat down together, and Childe Rowland told her all that he had\\n\\ndone, and she told him how their two brothers had reached the Dark\\n\\nTower, but had been enchanted by the King of Elfland, and lay there\\n\\nentombed as if dead. And then after they had talked a little longer\\n\\nChilde Rowland began to feel hungry from his long travels, and told his\\n\\nsister Burd Ellen how hungry he was and asked for some food, forgetting\\n\\nall about the Warlock Merlin\\'s warning.\\n\\n\\n\\nBurd Ellen looked at Childe Rowland sadly, and shook her head, but she\\n\\nwas under a spell, and could not warn him. So she rose up, and went out,\\n\\nand soon brought back a golden basin full of bread and milk. Childe\\n\\nRowland was just going to raise it to his lips, when he looked at his\\n\\nsister and remembered why he had come all that way. So he dashed the\\n\\nbowl to the ground, and said: \"Not a sup will I swallow, nor a bit will\\n\\nI bite, till Burd Ellen is set free.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nJust at that moment they heard the noise of some one approaching, and a\\n\\nloud voice was heard saying:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Fee, fi, fo, fum,\\n\\n    I smell the blood of a Christian man,\\n\\n    Be he dead, be he living, with my brand,\\n\\n    I\\'ll dash his brains from his brain-pan.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then the folding-doors of the hall were burst open, and the King of\\n\\nElfland rushed in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Strike, then, Bogle, if thou darest,\" shouted out Childe Rowland, and\\n\\nrushed to meet him with his good brand that never yet did fail. They\\n\\nfought, and they fought, and they fought, till Childe Rowland beat the\\n\\nKing of Elfland down on to his knees, and caused him to yield and beg\\n\\nfor mercy. \"I grant thee mercy,\" said Childe Rowland; \"release my sister\\n\\nfrom thy spells and raise my brothers to life, and let us all go free,\\n\\nand thou shalt be spared.\" \"I agree,\" said the Elfin King, and rising up\\n\\nhe went to a chest from which he took a phial filled with a blood-red\\n\\nliquor. With this he anointed the ears, eyelids, nostrils, lips, and\\n\\nfinger-tips of the two brothers, and they sprang at once into life, and\\n\\ndeclared that their souls had been away, but had now returned. The Elfin\\n\\nKing then said some words to Burd Ellen, and she was disenchanted, and\\n\\nthey all four passed out of the hall, through the long passage, and\\n\\nturned their back on the Dark Tower, never to return again. So they\\n\\nreached home, and the good queen their mother and Burd Ellen never went\\n\\nround a church \"widershins\"[30] again.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: TAM O\\' SHANTER]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 29: From _English Fairy Tales,_ by Joseph Jacobs.

The farmers had come\\n\\ninto town from all the country round about, to sell or exchange their\\n\\nfarm produce, and buy what they needed to take home.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmongst these farmers was a man by the name of Tam o\\' Shanter; a good\\n\\nnatured, happy-go-lucky sort of person, but, I am sorry to say, somewhat\\n\\nof a drunkard.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow Tam\\'s wife, whose name was Kate, was a grievous scold; always\\n\\nnagging and faultfinding, and I fear making it far easier for Tam to do\\n\\nwrong than if she had treated him more kindly. However that may be, Tam\\n\\nwas happier away from home; and this day had escaped his wife\\'s scolding\\n\\ntongue, mounted his good gray mare Meg, and galloped off as fast as he\\n\\ncould go to Market.\\n\\n\\n\\nTam, who was bent upon having a spree, found his good friend, the\\n\\nshoemaker Johnny, and off they went to their favorite ale house; where\\n\\nthey stayed telling stories and singing and drinking, till late at\\n\\nnight.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last the time came to go home and Tam who had forgotten the long\\n\\nmiles between him and the farm set forth, but a terrible storm had\\n\\nrisen; the wind blew, the rain fell in torrents and the thunder roared\\n\\nlong and loud.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a fearful night, black as pitch except for the blinding flashes\\n\\nof lightning; but Tam was well mounted on his good gray mare Maggie, and\\n\\nsplashed along through the wind and mire, holding on to his good blue\\n\\nbonnet, and singing aloud an old Scotch sonnet; while looking about him\\n\\nwith prudent care lest the bogies catch him unawares.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last he drew near to the old ruined church of Alloway. For many, many\\n\\nyears this old church had been roofless, but the walls were standing and\\n\\nit still retained the bell.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor many years it was said that the ghosts and witches nightly held\\n\\ntheir revels there, and sometimes rang the old bell. As Tam was crossing\\n\\nthe ford of the stream called the Doon, which flowed nearby, he looked\\n\\nup at the old church on the hillside above him, and behold! it was all\\n\\nablaze with lights, and sounds of mirth and dancing reached his ears.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow Tam had been made fearless by old John Barleycorn, and he made good\\n\\nMaggie take him close to the church so that he could look inside, and\\n\\nthere he saw the weirdest sight--\\n\\n\\n\\nWitches and ghosts in a mad dance, and the music was furnished by the\\n\\nDevil himself in the shape of a beast, who played upon the bagpipes, and\\n\\nmade them scream so loud that the very rafters rang with the sound.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was an awful sight; and as Tam looked in, amazed and curious, the fun\\n\\nand mirth grew fast and furious.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Piper loud and louder blew, and the dancers quick and quicker flew.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the witches resembled a handsome girl that Tam had known called\\n\\nNannie; Tam sat as one bewitched watching her as she danced, and at last\\n\\nlosing his wits altogether, called out: \"Weel done, Cutty-Sark!\"--and in\\n\\nan instant all was dark!\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had scarcely time to turn Maggie round, when all the legion of\\n\\nwitches and spirits were about him like a swarm of angry bees. As a\\n\\ncrowd runs, when the cry \"Catch the thief\" is heard, so runs Maggie; and\\n\\nthe witches follow with many an awful screech and halloo! Hurry, Meg!\\n\\nDo thy utmost! Win the keystone of the bridge, for a running stream they\\n\\n_dare_ not cross! _Then_ you can toss your tail at them! But before good\\n\\nMeg could reach the keystone of the bridge she had no tail to toss. For\\n\\nNannie far before the rest, hard upon noble Maggie prest,\\n\\nand flew at Tam with fury. But she little knew good Maggie\\'s\\n\\nmettle. With one spring, she brought off her master safe, but left\\n\\nbehind her own gray tail!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe witch had caught it and left poor Maggie with only a stump.\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 31: Prose Version, by Anna Cogswell Tyler.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTAM O\\' SHANTER[32]\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Of brownys and of bogilis full is this buke.\"--Gawin Douglas.\\n\\n\\n\\n    When chapman billies leave the street,\\n\\n    And drouthy neebors neebors meet,\\n\\n    As market-days are wearing late,\\n\\n    An\\' folk begin to tak\\' the gate;\\n\\n    While we sit bousing at the nappy,\\n\\n    An\\' gettin\\' fou and unco happy,\\n\\n    We think na on the lang Scots miles,\\n\\n    The mosses, waters, slaps, and stiles,\\n\\n    That lie between us and our hame,\\n\\n    Where sits our sulky sullen dame,\\n\\n    Gathering her brows like gathering storm,\\n\\n    Nursing her wrath to keep it warm.\\n\\n\\n\\n    This truth fand honest Tam o\\' Shanter,\\n\\n    As he frae Ayr ae night did canter,\\n\\n    (Auld Ayr, wham ne\\'er a town surpasses,\\n\\n    For honest men and bonny lasses.)\\n\\n    O Tam!

He caused a good\\n\\ndeal of trouble, and he kept tormenting the children, day and night, in\\n\\nvarious ways. Sometimes their bread and butter would be snatched away,\\n\\nor their porringers of bread and milk be capsized by an invisible hand;\\n\\nfor the Boggart never let himself be seen; at other times the curtains\\n\\nof their beds would be shaken backwards and forwards, or a heavy weight\\n\\nwould press on and nearly suffocate them. Their mother had often, on\\n\\nhearing their cries, to fly to their aid.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a kind of closet, formed by a wooden partition on the\\n\\nkitchen-stairs, and a large knot having been driven out of one of the\\n\\ndeal-boards of which it was made, there remained a round hole. Into\\n\\nthis, one day, the farmer\\'s youngest boy stuck the shoe-horn with which\\n\\nhe was amusing himself, when immediately it was thrown out again, and\\n\\nstruck the boy on the head. Of course it was the Boggart did this, and\\n\\nit soon became their sport, which they called _larking with the\\n\\nBoggart,_ to put the shoe-horn into the hole and have it shot back at\\n\\nthem. But the gamesome Boggart at length proved such a torment that the\\n\\nfarmer and his wife resolved to quit the house and let him have it all\\n\\nto himself. This settled, the flitting day came, and the farmer and his\\n\\nfamily were following the last loads of furniture, when a neighbor named\\n\\nJohn Marshall came up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Georgey,\" said he, \"and so you\\'re leaving t\\'ould hoose at last?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Heigh, Johnny, my lad, I\\'m forced to it; for that bad Boggart torments\\n\\nus so, we can neither rest night nor day for\\'t. It seems to have such a\\n\\nmalice against t\\'poor bairns, it almost kills my poor dame here at\\n\\nthoughts on\\'t, and so, ye see, we\\'re forced to flitt loike.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe scarce had uttered the words when a voice from a deep upright churn\\n\\ncried out. _\"Aye, aye, Georgey, we\\'re flittin ye see!\"_\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ods, alive!\" cried the farmer, \"if I\\'d known thou would flit too, I\\'d\\n\\nnot have stirred a peg!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd with that, he turned about to his wife, and told her they might as\\n\\nwell stay in the old house, as be bothered by the Boggart in a new one.\\n\\nSo stay they did.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 33: From _Fairy-Gold_, a book of old English Fairy Tales.\\n\\nChosen by Ernest Rhys.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Twenty-Four Unusual Stories for Boys\\n\\nand Girls, by Anna Cogswell Tyler\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

As Emperor I am overwhelmed with\\n\\ntroubles, while here in this convent, which is a little kingdom in\\n\\nitself, one would have nothing to worry about. I cannot believe it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nImmediately on setting foot in the village inn, the Emperor sent the\\n\\nhostess to fetch the Abbot of this singular convent.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can imagine what a state of mind the latter was in when he heard he\\n\\nwas summoned to the Emperor\\'s presence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What have I done to displease him?\" he asked himself. On the way he\\n\\nexamined his conscience over and over again, and he could think of no\\n\\nfault of which he was guilty. \"I am in troubled waters; I must steer my\\n\\nway through,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he was in the Emperor\\'s presence, the latter expressed his\\n\\nastonishment of what he had read.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Abbot now knew why he had been summoned, and smiled. \"Sir,\" said he,\\n\\n\"does that astonish you? However, it is very simple; we eat, we drink,\\n\\nwe sleep, and worry over nothing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Reverend Abbot, that state of things must come to an end,\" said\\n\\nthe Emperor, \"and in order that you may have your share of trouble, I\\n\\ncommand you to bring me to-morrow the answers to the three following\\n\\nquestions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"First, What is the depth of the sea?\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Secondly, How many cows\\' tails would it take to measure the distance\\n\\nbetween the earth and the sun?\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thirdly, What am I thinking about?\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Try to please me or I shall exact a penalty from you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nOn hearing these words, the Abbot returned to his convent with a heavy\\n\\nheart. From that moment he knew no peace. He cudgeled his brains as to\\n\\nwhat answer he could make to the Emperor.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the little bell of the abbey rang, summoning the monks to prayer in\\n\\nthe chapel, the Abbot continued to pace his garden. He was so deep in\\n\\nthought that he was quite oblivious of what was taking place around him.\\n\\nEven if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet, he would not have noticed\\n\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What a horrible thing,\" he thought. \"Is it possible that such a\\n\\nmisfortune has overtaken me? I cannot possibly answer. Who can save the\\n\\nsituation? Perhaps our shepherd could; he has a very lively imagination;\\n\\nbut talk of the devil--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAt that identical moment the shepherd appeared, leading his flock. He\\n\\nwas very surprised to see the Abbot, who was always without a care,\\n\\nmediating in solitude.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat could have happened?\\n\\n\\n\\nWithout more ado he went to him, and asked him what was troubling him so\\n\\ndeeply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I deserve to be pitied,\" said the Abbot, and he told him what had\\n\\nhappened.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why are you tormenting yourself over a little thing like that?\" the\\n\\nshepherd laughingly replied. \"Leave it to me, and all will be well.\\n\\nTo-morrow I will come here and dress myself in your robe, and I will\\n\\nturn the tables on him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAt first the Abbot demurred, but in the end he yielded, and the matter\\n\\nwas settled.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next day the shepherd went boldly to find the Emperor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Reverend Abbot,\" the Emperor said with serenity, \"have you found\\n\\nout the answers?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, certainly, sire.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Speak, I am listening.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sire, the sea is as deep as a stone\\'s throw.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"To measure the distance between the earth and the sun, you only need\\n\\none cow\\'s tail, if it is long enough.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you wish to know, sire, what you are thinking? Well, at this moment,\\n\\nyou think, sire, that the Abbot of the convent is in your presence, and\\n\\nit is only his shepherd.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Emperor laughed so heartily that if he has not stopped laughing he\\n\\nis laughing still.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: \"WHAT THE GOOD-MAN DOES IS SURE TO BE RIGHT!\"]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 1: In _Christmas Tales of Flanders._ Illustrated and collected\\n\\nby Jean De Bosschere. Dodd, Mead & Company.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"WHAT THE GOOD-MAN DOES IS SURE TO BE RIGHT!\"[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI AM going to tell you a story that was told to me when I was a little\\n\\none, and which I like better and better the oftener I think of it. For\\n\\nit is with stories as with some men and women, the older they grow, the\\n\\npleasanter they grow, and that is delightful!\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course you have been into the country? Well, then, you must have seen\\n\\na regularly poor old cottage. Moss and weeds spring up amid the thatch\\n\\nof the roof, a stork\\'s nest decorates the chimney (the stork can never\\n\\nbe dispensed with), the walls are aslant, the windows low (in fact, only\\n\\none of them can be shut), the baking-oven projects forward, and an\\n\\nelder-bush leans over the gate, where you will see a tiny pond with a\\n\\nduck and ducklings in it, close under a knotted old willow-tree. Yes,\\n\\nand then there is a watch-dog that barks at every passer-by.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust such a poor little cottage as this was the one in my story, and in\\n\\nit dwelt a husband and wife. Few as their possessions were, one of them\\n\\nthey could do without, and that was a horse, that used to graze in the\\n\\nditch beside the highroad. The good-man rode on it to town, he lent it\\n\\nto his neighbors, and received slight services from them in return, but\\n\\nstill it would be more profitable to sell the horse, or else exchange it\\n\\nfor something they could make of more frequent use. But which should\\n\\nthey do? sell, or exchange?\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, you will find out what is best, good-man,\" said the wife. \"Isn\\'t\\n\\nthis market-day? Come, ride off to the town--get money, or what you can\\n\\nfor the horse--whatever you do is sure to be right. Make haste for the\\n\\nmarket!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo she tied on his neckerchief--for that was a matter she understood\\n\\nbetter than he--she tied it with a double knot, and made him look quite\\n\\nspruce; she dusted his hat with the palm of her hand; and she kissed him\\n\\nand sent him off, riding the horse that was to be either sold or\\n\\nbartered. Of course, he would know what to do.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sun was hot, and not a cloud in the sky. The road was dusty, and\\n\\nsuch a crowd of folk passed on their way to market. Some in wagons, some\\n\\non horseback, some on their own legs. A fierce sun and no shade all the\\n\\nway.\\n\\n\\n\\nA man came driving a cow--as pretty a cow as could be. \"That creature\\n\\nmust give beautiful milk,\" thought the peasant; \"it would not be a bad\\n\\nbargain if I got that. I say, you fellow with the cow!\" he began aloud:\\n\\n\"let\\'s have some talk together. Look you, a horse, I believe, costs more\\n\\nthan a cow, but it is all the same to me, as I have more use for a\\n\\ncow--shall we make an exchange?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"To be sure!\" was the answer, and the bargain was made.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe good-man might just as well now turn back homeward--he had finished\\n\\nhis business. But he had made up his mind to go to market, so to market\\n\\nhe must go, if only to look on, so, with his cow, he continued on his\\n\\nway. He trudged fast, so did the cow, and soon they overtook a man who\\n\\nwas leading a sheep--a sheep in good condition, well clothed with wool.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I should very much like to have that!\" said the peasant. \"It would find\\n\\npasture enough by our road-side, and in winter we might take it into our\\n\\nown room. And really it would be more reasonable for us to be keeping a\\n\\nsheep than a cow. Shall we exchange?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, the man who owned the sheep was quite willing; so the exchange was\\n\\nmade, and the good-man now went on with his sheep. Presently there\\n\\npassed him a man with a big goose under his arm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, you have got a heavy fellow there!\" quoth the peasant. \"Feathers\\n\\nand fat in plenty! How nicely we could tie her up near our little pond,\\n\\nand it would be something for the good-wife to gather up the scraps for.\\n\\nShe has often said: \\'If we had but a goose!\\' Now she can have one--and\\n\\nshe shall, too! Will you exchange? I will give you my sheep for your\\n\\ngoose, and say \\'thank you\\' besides.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe other had no objection, so the peasant had his will and his goose.\\n\\nHe was now close to the town; he was wearied with the heat and the\\n\\ncrowd, folk and cattle pushing past him, thronging on the road, in the\\n\\nditch, and close up to the turnpike-man\\'s cabbage-garden, where his one\\n\\nhen was tied up, lest in her fright she should lose her way and be\\n\\ncarried off. It was a short-backed hen: she winked with one eye, crying,\\n\\n\"Cluck, cluck!\" What she was thinking of I can\\'t say, but what the\\n\\npeasant thought on seeing her, was this: \"That is the prettiest hen I\\n\\nhave ever seen--much prettier than any of our parson\\'s chickens. I\\n\\nshould very much like to have her. A hen can always pick up a grain here\\n\\nand there--can provide for herself. I almost think it would be a good\\n\\nplan to take her instead of the goose. Shall we exchange?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Exchange?\" repeated the owner; \"not a bad idea!\" So it was done; the\\n\\nturnpike-man got the goose, the peasant the hen.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had transacted a deal of business since first starting on his way to\\n\\nthe town; hot was he, and wearied too; he must have a dram and a bit of\\n\\nbread. He was on the point of entering an inn, when the innkeeper met\\n\\nhim in the doorway swinging a sack chock-full of something.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What have you there?\" asked the peasant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mellow apples,\" was the answer, \"a whole sackful for swine.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What a quantity! wouldn\\'t my wife like to see so many! Why, the last\\n\\nyear we had only one single apple on the whole tree at home. Ah! I wish\\n\\nmy wife could see them!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, what will you give me for them?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Give for them? why, I will give you my hen.\" So he gave the hen, took\\n\\nthe apples, and entered the inn, and going straight up to the bar, set\\n\\nhis sack upright against the stove without considering that there was a\\n\\nfire lighted inside. A good many strangers were present, among them two\\n\\nEnglishmen, both with their pockets full of gold, and fond of laying\\n\\nwagers, as Englishmen in stories are wont to be.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently there came a sound from the stove, \"Suss--suss--suss!\" the\\n\\napples were roasting. \"What is that?\" folk asked, and soon heard the\\n\\nwhole history of the horse that had been exchanged, first for a cow, and\\n\\nlastly for a sack of rotten apples.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well! won\\'t you get a good sound cuff from your wife, when you go\\n\\nhome?\" said one of the Englishmen. \"Something heavy enough to fell an\\n\\nox, I warn you!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I shall get kisses, not cuffs,\" replied the peasant. \"My wife will say,\\n\\n\\'Whatever the good-man does is right.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"A wager!\" cried the Englishmen, \"for a hundred pounds?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Say rather a bushelful,\" quoth the peasant, \"and I can only lay my\\n\\nbushel of apples with myself and the good-wife, but that will be more\\n\\nthan full measure, I trow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Done!\" cried they. And the innkeeper\\'s cart was brought out forthwith,\\n\\nthe Englishmen got into it, the peasant got into it, the rotten apples\\n\\ngot into it, and away they sped to the peasant\\'s cottage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Good evening, wife.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Same to you, good-man.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I have exchanged the horse, not sold it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said the wife, taking his hand, and in her eagerness to\\n\\nlisten noticing neither the sack nor the strangers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I exchanged the horse for a cow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"O! how delightful! now we can have milk, butter, and cheese, on our\\n\\ntable. What a capital idea!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, but I exchanged the cow for a sheep.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Better and better!\" cried the wife. \"You are always so thoughtful; we\\n\\nhave only just grass enough for a sheep. But now we shall have ewe\\'s\\n\\nmilk, and ewe\\'s cheese, and woolen stockings, nay, woolen jackets too;\\n\\nand a cow would not give us that; she loses all her hairs. But you are\\n\\nalways such a clever fellow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But the ewe I exchanged again for a goose.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What! shall we really keep Michaelmas this year, good-man? You are\\n\\nalways thinking of what will please me, and that was a beautiful\\n\\nthought. The goose can be tethered to the willow-tree and grow fat for\\n\\nMichaelmas Day.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But I gave the goose away for a hen,\" said the peasant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"A hen? well, that was a good exchange,\" said his wife. \"A hen will lay\\n\\neggs, sit upon them, and we shall have chickens. Fancy! a hen-yard! that\\n\\nis just the thing I have always wished for most.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, but I exchanged the hen for a sack of mellow apples.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then I must give thee a kiss,\" cried the wife. \"Thanks, my own husband.\\n\\nAnd now I have something to tell. When you were gone I thought how I\\n\\ncould get a right good dinner ready for you: omelets with parsley. Now I\\n\\nhad the eggs, but not the parsley. So I went over to the schoolmaster\\'s;\\n\\nthey have parsley, I know, but the woman is so crabbed, she wanted\\n\\nsomething for it. Now what could I give her? nothing grows in our\\n\\ngarden, not even a rotten apple, not even that had I for her; but now I\\n\\ncan give her ten, nay, a whole sackful. That is famous, good-man!\" and\\n\\nshe kissed him again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well done!\" cried the Englishmen. \"Always down hill, and always happy!\\n\\nSuch a sight is worth the money!\" And so quite contentedly they paid the\\n\\nbushelful of gold pieces to the peasant, who had got kisses, not cuffs,\\n\\nby his bargains.\\n\\n\\n\\nCertainly virtue is her own reward, when the wife is sure that her\\n\\nhusband is the wisest man in the world, and that whatever he does is\\n\\nright. So now you have heard this old story that was once told to me,\\n\\nand I hope have learnt the moral.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: WHERE TO LAY THE BLAME]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 2: Reprinted by special permission from _Stories and Tales_,\\n\\nby Hans Christian Andersen. Copyright by Houghton, Mifflin Company.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHERE TO LAY THE BLAME[3]\\n\\n\\n\\n     Many and many a man has come to trouble--so he will say--by\\n\\n     following his wife\\'s advice. This is how it was with a man of whom\\n\\n     I shall tell you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHERE was once upon a time a fisherman who had fished all day long and\\n\\nhad caught not so much as a sprat. So at night there he sat by the fire,\\n\\nrubbing his knees and warming his shins, and waiting for supper that his\\n\\nwife was cooking for him, and his hunger was as sharp as vinegar, and\\n\\nhis temper hot enough to fry fat.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile he sat there grumbling and growling and trying to make himself\\n\\ncomfortable and warm, there suddenly came a knock at the door. The good\\n\\nwoman opened it, and there stood an old man, clad all in red from head\\n\\nto foot, and with a snowy beard at his chin as white as winter snow.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fisherman\\'s wife stood gasping and staring at the strange figure,\\n\\nbut the old man in red walked straight into the hut. \"Bring your nets,\\n\\nfisherman,\" said he, \"and come with me. There is something that I want\\n\\nyou to catch for me, and if I have luck I will pay you for your fishing\\n\\nas never fisherman was paid before.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not I,\" said the fisherman; \"I go out no more this night. I have been\\n\\nfishing all day long until my back is nearly broken, and have caught\\n\\nnothing, and now I am not such a fool as to go out and leave a good\\n\\nsupper and a warm fire at your bidding.\" But the fisherman\\'s wife had\\n\\nlistened to what the old man had said about paying for the job, and she\\n\\nwas of a different mind from her husband. \"Come,\" said she, \"the old man\\n\\npromises to pay you well. This is not a chance to be lost, I can tell\\n\\nyou, and my advice to you is that you go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fisherman shook his head. No, he would not go; he had said he would\\n\\nnot, and he would not. But the wife only smiled and said again, \"My\\n\\nadvice to you is that you go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fisherman grumbled and grumbled, and swore that he would not go. The\\n\\nwife said nothing but one thing. She did not argue; she did not lose her\\n\\ntemper; she only said to everything that he said, \"My advice to you is\\n\\nthat you go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last the fisherman\\'s anger boiled over. \"Very well,\" said he,\\n\\nspitting his words at her; \"if you drive me out into the night, I\\n\\nsuppose I will have to go.\" And then he spoke the words that so many men\\n\\nsay: \"Many a man has come to trouble by following his wife\\'s advice.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen down he took his fur cap and up he took his nets, and off he and\\n\\nthe old man marched through the moonlight, their shadows bobbing along\\n\\nlike black spiders behind them.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, on they went, out from the town and across the fields and through\\n\\nthe woods, until at last they came to a dreary, lonesome desert, where\\n\\nnothing was to be seen but gray rocks and weeds and thistles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the fisherman, \"I have fished, man and boy, for forty-seven\\n\\nyears, but never did I see as unlikely a place to catch anything as\\n\\nthis.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the old man said never a word. First of all he drew a great circle\\n\\nwith strange figures, marking it with his finger upon the ground. Then\\n\\nout from under his red gown he brought a tinder-box and steel, and a\\n\\nlittle silver casket covered all over with strange figures of serpents\\n\\nand dragons and what not. He brought some sticks of spice-wood from his\\n\\npouch, and then he struck a light and made a fire. Out of the box he\\n\\ntook a gray powder, which he flung upon the little blaze.\\n\\n\\n\\nPuff! flash! A vivid flame went up into the moonlight, and then a dense\\n\\nsmoke as black as ink, which spread out wider and wider, far and near,\\n\\ntill all below was darker than the darkest midnight. Then the old man\\n\\nbegan to utter strange spells and words.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently there began a rumbling that sounded louder and louder and\\n\\nnearer and nearer, until it roared and bellowed like thunder. The earth\\n\\nrocked and swayed, and the poor fisherman shook and trembled with fear\\n\\ntill his teeth chattered in his head.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen suddenly the roaring and bellowing ceased, and all was as still as\\n\\ndeath, though the darkness was as thick and black as ever. \"Now,\" said\\n\\nthe old magician--for such he was--\"now we are about to take a journey\\n\\nsuch as no one ever traveled before. Heed well what I tell you. Speak\\n\\nnot a single word, for if you do, misfortune will be sure to happen.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ain\\'t I to say anything?\" said the fisherman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not even \\'boo\\' to a goose?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, that is pretty hard upon a man who likes to say his say,\" said\\n\\nthe fisherman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And moreover,\" said the old man, \"I must blindfold you as well.\"\\n\\nThereupon he took from his pocket a handkerchief, and made ready to tie\\n\\nit about the fisherman\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And ain\\'t I to see anything at all?\" said the fisherman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not even so much as a single feather?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, then,\" said the fisherman, \"I wish I\\'d not come.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the old man tied the handkerchief tightly around his eyes, and then\\n\\nhe was as blind as a bat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now,\" said the old man, \"throw your leg over what you feel and hold\\n\\nfast.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fisherman reached down his hand, and there felt the back of\\n\\nsomething rough and hairy. He flung his leg over it, and whisk! whizz!\\n\\noff he shot through the air like a sky-rocket. Nothing was left for him\\n\\nto do but grip tightly with hands and feet and to hold fast. On they\\n\\nwent, and on they went, until, after a great while, whatever it was that\\n\\nwas carrying him lit upon the ground, and there the fisherman found\\n\\nhimself standing, for that which had brought him had gone.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe old man whipped the handkerchief off his eyes, and there the\\n\\nfisherman found himself on the shores of the sea, where there was\\n\\nnothing to be seen but water upon one side and rocks and naked sand\\n\\nupon the other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This is the place for you to cast your nets,\" said the old magician;\\n\\n\"for if we catch nothing here we catch nothing at all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fisherman unrolled his nets and cast them and dragged them, and then\\n\\ncast them and dragged them again, but neither time caught so much as a\\n\\nherring. But the third time that he cast he found that he had caught\\n\\nsomething that weighed as heavy as lead. He pulled and pulled, until\\n\\nby-and-by he dragged the load ashore, and what should it be but a great\\n\\nchest of wood, blackened by sea-water, and covered with shells and green\\n\\nmoss.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat was the very thing that the magician had come to fish for. From his\\n\\npouch the old man took a little golden key, which he fitted into a\\n\\nkey-hole in the side of the chest. He threw back the lid; the fisherman\\n\\nlooked within, and there was the prettiest little palace that man\\'s eye\\n\\never beheld, all made of mother-of-pearl and silver-frosted as white as\\n\\nsnow. The old magician lifted the little palace out of the box and set\\n\\nit upon the ground.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, lo and behold! a marvelous thing happened; for the palace\\n\\ninstantly began to grow for all the world like a soap-bubble, until it\\n\\nstood in the moonlight gleaming and glistening like snow, the windows\\n\\nbright with the lights of a thousand wax tapers, and the sound of music\\n\\nand voices and laughter coming from within.\\n\\n\\n\\nHardly could the fisherman catch his breath from one strange thing when\\n\\nanother happened. The old magician took off his clothes and his\\n\\nface--yes, his face--for all the world as though it had been a mask, and\\n\\nthere stood as handsome and noble a young man as ever the light looked\\n\\non. Then, beckoning to the fisherman, dumb with wonder, he led the way\\n\\nup the great flight of marble steps to the palace door. As he came the\\n\\ndoor swung open with a blaze of light, and there stood hundreds of\\n\\nnoblemen, all clad in silks and satins and velvets, who, when they saw\\n\\nthe magician, bowed low before him, as though he had been a king.\\n\\nLeading the way, they brought the two through halls and chambers and\\n\\nroom after room, each more magnificent than the other, until they came\\n\\nto one that surpassed a hundredfold any of the others.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the farther end was a golden throne, and upon it sat a lady more\\n\\nlovely and beautiful than a dream, her eyes as bright as diamonds, her\\n\\ncheeks like rose leaves, and her hair like spun gold. She came half-way\\n\\ndown the steps of the throne to welcome the magician, and when the two\\n\\nmet they kissed one another before all those who were looking on. Then\\n\\nshe brought him to the throne and seated him beside her, and there they\\n\\ntalked for a long time very earnestly.\\n\\n\\n\\nNobody said a word to the fisherman, who stood staring about him like an\\n\\nowl. \"I wonder,\" said he to himself at last, \"if they will give a body a\\n\\nbite to eat by-and-by?\" for, to tell the truth, the good supper he had\\n\\ncome away from at home had left a sharp hunger gnawing at his insides,\\n\\nand he longed for something good and warm to fill the empty place. But\\n\\ntime passed, and not so much as a crust of bread was brought to stay his\\n\\nstomach.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy-and-by the clock struck twelve, and then the two who sat upon the\\n\\nthrone arose. The beautiful lady took the magician by the hand, and,\\n\\nturning to those who stood around, said, in a loud voice, \"Behold him\\n\\nwho alone is worthy to possess the jewel of jewels! Unto him do I give\\n\\nit, and with it all power of powers!\" Thereon she opened a golden casket\\n\\nthat stood beside her, and brought thence a little crystal ball, about\\n\\nas big as a pigeon\\'s egg, in which was something that glistened like a\\n\\nspark of fire. The magician took the crystal ball and thrust it into his\\n\\nbosom; but what it was the fisherman could not guess, and if you do not\\n\\nknow I shall not tell you.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen for the first time the beautiful lady seemed to notice the\\n\\nfisherman. She beckoned him, and when he stood beside her two men came\\n\\ncarrying a chest. The chief treasurer opened it, and it was full of bags\\n\\nof gold money. \"How will you have it?\" said the beautiful lady.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Have what?\" said the fisherman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Have the pay for your labor?\" said the beautiful lady.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I will,\" said the fisherman, promptly, \"take it in my hat.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So be it,\" said the beautiful lady. She waved her hand, and the chief\\n\\ntreasurer took a bag from the chest, untied it, and emptied a cataract\\n\\nof gold into the fur cap. The fisherman had never seen so much wealth in\\n\\nall his life before, and he stood like a man turned to stone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is all this mine?\" said the fisherman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is,\" said the beautiful lady.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then God bless your pretty eyes,\" said the fisherman.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the magician kissed the beautiful lady, and, beckoning to the\\n\\nfisherman, left the throne room the same way that they had come. The\\n\\nnoblemen, in silks and satins and velvets, marched ahead, and back they\\n\\nwent through the other apartments, until at last they came to the door.\\n\\nOut they stepped, and then what do you suppose happened!\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the wonderful palace had grown like a bubble, like a bubble it\\n\\nvanished. There the two stood on the sea-shore, with nothing to be seen\\n\\nbut rocks and sand and water, and the starry sky overhead. The fisherman\\n\\nshook his cap of gold, and it jingled and tinkled, and was as heavy as\\n\\nlead. If it was not all a dream, he was rich for life. \"But anyhow,\"\\n\\nsaid he, \"they might have given a body a bite to eat.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe magician put on his red clothes and his face again, making himself\\n\\nas hoary and as old as before. He took out flint and steel, and his\\n\\nsticks of spice-wood and his gray powder, and made a great fire and\\n\\nsmoke just as he had done before. Then again he tied his handkerchief\\n\\nover the fisherman\\'s eyes. \"Remember,\" said he, \"what I told you when we\\n\\nstarted upon our journey. Keep your mouth tight shut, for if you utter\\n\\nso much as a single word you are a lost man. Now throw your leg over\\n\\nwhat you feel and hold fast.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fisherman had his net over one arm and his cap of gold in the other\\n\\nhand; nevertheless, there he felt the same hairy thing he had felt\\n\\nbefore. He flung his leg over it, and away he was gone through the air\\n\\nlike a sky-rocket.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, he had grown somewhat used to strange things by this time, so he\\n\\nbegan to think he would like to see what sort of a creature it was upon\\n\\nwhich he was riding thus through the sky. So he contrived, in spite of\\n\\nhis net and cap, to push up the handkerchief from over one eye. Out he\\n\\npeeped, and then he saw what the strange steed was. He was riding upon a\\n\\nhe-goat as black as night, and in front of him was the magician riding\\n\\nupon just such another, his great red robe fluttering out in the\\n\\nmoonlight like huge red wings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Great herring and little fishes!\" roared the fisherman; \"it is a\\n\\nbilly-goat!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nInstantly goats, old man, and all were gone like a flash. Down fell the\\n\\nfisherman through the empty sky, whirling over and over and around and\\n\\naround like a frog. He held tightly to his net, but away flew his fur\\n\\ncap, the golden money falling in a shower like sparks of yellow light.\\n\\nDown he fell and down he fell, until his head spun like a top.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy good-luck his house was just below, with its thatch of soft rushes.\\n\\nInto the very middle of it he tumbled, and right through the\\n\\nthatch--bump!--into the room below.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe good wife was in bed, snoring away for dear life; but such a noise\\n\\nas the fisherman made coming into the house was enough to wake the dead.\\n\\nUp she jumped, and there she sat, staring and winking with sleep, and\\n\\nwith her brains as addled as a duck\\'s egg in a thunderstorm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There!\" said the fisherman, as he gathered himself up and rubbed his\\n\\nshoulder, \"that is what comes of following a woman\\'s advice!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: THE WINDS, THE BIRDS, AND THE TELEGRAPH WIRES]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 3: Reprinted by special permission from _Twilight Land,_ by\\n\\nHoward Pyle. Copyright by Harper & Brothers]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE WINDS, THE BIRDS, AND THE TELEGRAPH WIRES[4]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLONG, long ago, a hundred times as long as any one can remember, the\\n\\nGreat Earth King became so very, very busy about a great many things\\n\\nthat there were several things that he could not do. So he sat himself\\n\\ndown and rested his great head upon his hand, and thought, and thought,\\n\\nand thought until he decided that he must have some assistance. He would\\n\\nadvertise for some messengers! So he seized a great brush, as big as a\\n\\nchurch steeple, dipped it into the red and golden sunset light, and\\n\\nwrote in big letters high on the sky, that every one far and near could\\n\\nread:\\n\\n\\n\\n     WANTED! MESSENGERS! FLEETER THAN HORSES, SWIFTER THAN MEN, TO CARRY\\n\\n     MY MESSAGES, A MILLION TIMES TEN.\\n\\n\\n\\nand he signed it simply, \"The Earth King.\" Then he went into his rainbow\\n\\nhouse and laid himself down to sleep on his rainbow bed.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had scarcely fallen asleep when there came a _rustle, rustle,\\n\\nrustle_ at the rainbow window,\\n\\nand a _rattle, rattle, rattle_ at the rainbow door. He sprang quickly\\n\\nfrom his great bed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who be ye?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We be messengers,\" came the reply, \"come to serve the King.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the King opened the door. There before him stood four of the\\n\\nstrangest creatures that he had ever seen. They were so light that they\\n\\ncould stand on nothing; they had great wide wings; they had pale faces\\n\\nand gleaming eyes; and they had light garments that floated and flapped\\n\\nand fluttered in the breeze.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What are your names?\" asked the King.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We are the Winds,\" answered the mightiest of the four, \"East Wind, West\\n\\nWind, South Wind, North Wind,\" pointing to each in turn, himself last.\\n\\n\"We have come--\\n\\n\\n\\n    _Fleeter than horses, swifter than men,\\n\\n    To carry your messages, a million times ten._\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the King spoke to them in deep and solemn tone: \"The task is a\\n\\ngreat one. The King\\'s business is grave and important. My messengers\\n\\nmust be swift and faithful. Are ye able?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the four winds piously crossed their breasts with their wings and\\n\\nwhispered, \"Try us and see, try us and see, try us and see.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the King tried them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Down by the sea,\" said the King, \"far over the mountains, many hours\\n\\naway, there lives a fisher folk that I love. Every day the men of the\\n\\nvillage go forth in their little boats to fish, and every evening they\\n\\ncome home with their catch. But of late thick and heavy clouds have hung\\n\\nabout them. They have not dared go forth lest they should not reach home\\n\\nagain, and their families begin to be in want. Go to them to-day. Drive\\n\\naway the fog and clouds that the people may be happy again. Quick!\\n\\naway!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the four winds lifted their swift, beautiful wings and were gone.\\n\\nFaster and faster they flew till none could tell how fast they flew.\\n\\nOver the meadows they went and over the mountains. Each tried to\\n\\noutwing the others until it became a fierce and careless game. So\\n\\nblind and careless were they in their sport that they did not notice how\\n\\nthey whirled the sand, and broke the trees, and tossed the water.\\n\\nSwiftly through the fishing village they tore, hurling its poor houses\\n\\nto the ground and _crashing, dashing, slashing, smashing_ the waves\\n\\nupon the fallen wrecks and the frightened and suffering folk.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot until they were weary with their furious sport did they remember the\\n\\nerrand on which the King had sent them. They retraced their steps as\\n\\nquickly as they could, but alas! to their shame and grief, the village\\n\\nlay in ruins and the people wept for their loss.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the Earth King was very sad and angry. He brought the shameful\\n\\nwinds before his court. \"False and faithless winds,\" he said, in stern\\n\\nand awful voice, \"ye did not do my errand; ye were traitors to your\\n\\ntrust; great shall be your punishment. Nevermore shall ye be my\\n\\nmessengers, evermore shall ye be my slaves. Away from my sight!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the faithless winds departed from before the face of the King, and\\n\\nin shame and sorrow went moaning among the caves and the rocks by the\\n\\nseaside, and sighing among the lonely pine trees in the wilderness, and\\n\\neven to this day you may hear the echoes of their moans and sighs.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Earth King was sorrowful, but not discouraged. Again he seized the\\n\\ngreat paint brush, as big as a church steeple, dipped it into the red\\n\\nand golden sunset light, and wrote in big letters high on the sky that\\n\\nevery one far and near could read:\\n\\n\\n\\n    WANTED! MESSENGERS!\\n\\n    FLEETER THAN HORSES,\\n\\n    SWIFTER THAN MEN,\\n\\n    TO CARRY MY MESSAGES,\\n\\n    A MILLION TIMES TEN.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he went into his rainbow house and laid himself down on his rainbow\\n\\nbed. He scarcely had taken forty winks when he heard a _rat-tat-tatting_\\n\\non the rainbow window and a _rap-rap-rapping_ on the rainbow door.\\n\\nQuickly he leaped from his great bed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who be ye?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We be messengers,\" came a gentle voice through the keyhole, \"come to\\n\\nserve the King.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he opened the door, and there before him flitted and twittered a\\n\\ncompany of the most curious little people that he ever had set eyes\\n\\nupon. They had each a pair of beady eyes, a little pointed nose, a set\\n\\nof little scratchy toes, and the softest kind of a coat, fitting as snug\\n\\nas ever the tailor could make it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What are your names?\" asked the King.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We are the birds, and our names are many. We saw the King\\'s sign in the\\n\\nsky and have come--\\n\\n\\n\\n    _Fleeter than horses, swifter than men,\\n\\n    To carry your messages, a million times ten.\"_\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the King, remembering the Winds, addressed them in very deep and\\n\\nsolemn tones: \"The task is a great one. The King\\'s business is exceeding\\n\\ngrave and important. My messengers must be swift and faithful, must\\n\\nremember my commands and keep my secrets. Are ye able?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nEach bird laid his little scratchy toes on his little pointed nose and\\n\\nvowed that he would remember the King\\'s commands and keep the King\\'s\\n\\nsecrets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then,\" said the King, \"make ready. Far to the north dwells a people\\n\\nthat I love. For many a month they have lived amid ice and snow and the\\n\\nbitter frosts. Now they sigh for warmer days, and I have heard them. I\\n\\nam planning a delightful surprise for them. I am going to carry spring\\n\\nto them. Go, find the warm sunshine and the soft south wind and bid them\\n\\ncome at once to the King\\'s court, that I may take them and the spring\\n\\ndays to my suffering and discouraged people. Then return with all speed\\n\\nto the King, and remember --do not betray my secret.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bird-messengers hastened away as fast as ever their wings could\\n\\ncarry them. They summoned the warm sunshine and the soft south wind and\\n\\nbade them make haste to the Earth King. They, of course, turned back as\\n\\nthey were commanded, but before they reached home again, each one of\\n\\nthem was seized with a strange, restless, uneasy feeling right in the\\n\\nmiddle of his feathers. It must have been the secret trying to get out.\\n\\nOne by one they stole past the King\\'s house under cover of the night and\\n\\nmade their way to the north country. And when the morning came, there\\n\\nthey were, sitting on the fence posts and in the apple trees, just\\n\\nbursting with the happy secret of the King.\\n\\n\\n\\n    _Then the robin pipped, and the bluebird blew;\\n\\n    The sparrow chipped, and the swallow, too:\\n\\n    \"We know something,--we won\\'t tell,--\\n\\n    Somebody\\'s coming,--you know well.\\n\\n    This is his name (\\'twixt you and me),\\n\\n          S-P-R-I-N-G.\"_\\n\\n\\n\\nThe people were very happy when they heard what the birds said, and with\\n\\nmuch excitement began to get ready for the springtime.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, of course, the King knew nothing about all this, and was very happy\\n\\nin thinking of the surprise that he was to give the people. He took the\\n\\nwarm sunshine and the soft south wind for companions, and made his way\\n\\nin all haste to the land of ice and snow. As he arrived, with his\\n\\ndelightful secret, as he thought, hidden in his heart, he was amazed to\\n\\nfind an old woman sitting in her doorway knitting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why are you sitting here?\" he asked. \"Why are you not within, warming\\n\\nyour feet by the fire?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, don\\'t you know?\" she said, \"spring is coming!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Spring?\" he asked, almost roughly; \"how do you know?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said she with a smile, trying not to look at a robin that turned\\n\\nhis back behind the picket fence, hoping that if the King saw him he\\n\\nmight think he was an English sparrow, \"a little bird told me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe King walked up the street, looking gloomy enough, and soon came\\n\\nacross a gardener with his rake, uncovering the crocuses and the\\n\\ndaffodils.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why do you do this, my good man? Surely your flowers will freeze. You\\n\\nhad much better be covering them up.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, no,\" he said, straightening his bent back, \"spring is coming.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Spring,\" said the King; \"how do _you_ know?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said the gardener, with a grin, and a twinkle in his left eye, as\\n\\nhe caught sight of a bluebird peeking half-scared around the limb of a\\n\\nnear-by apple tree, \"a little bird told me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the disgraceful story all came out: that\\n\\n\\n\\n    _The robin pipped, and the bluebird blew;\\n\\n    The sparrow chipped, and the swallow, too:\\n\\n    \"We know something,--we won\\'t tell,--\\n\\n    Somebody\\'s coming,--you know well.\\n\\n    This is his name (\\'twixt you and me),\\n\\n          S-P-R-I-N-G.\"_\\n\\n\\n\\nMy! but wasn\\'t the Earth King disgusted! And weren\\'t the bird-messengers\\n\\nashamed to come when he sternly called them! Each laid his little\\n\\npointed nose on his little scratchy toes, and dropped his eyes and\\n\\nuttered never a word.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Silly birds,\" he said in scornful voice. \"You vowed to keep my secrets.\\n\\nYou have broken your vow. You obeyed my commands and called the south\\n\\nwind and the sunshine; so I cannot be too harsh with you. But you cannot\\n\\nkeep my secrets, so I cannot keep you as my messengers. Now and then I\\n\\nmay use you as my servants. Adieu!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the birds flew sadly away as quietly and quickly as ever they\\n\\ncould, and set to work building their nests in holes in the trees and\\n\\nholes in the ground and in out-of-the-way places, making such a\\n\\nchattering meantime that neither they, nor any one else, could hear\\n\\nthemselves think.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy this time the Earth King was nearly discouraged. He did not know what\\n\\nin the world to do. He rested his elbow on his knee and his great head\\n\\nin his hand and thought and wondered. Then once again he rose and took\\n\\nthe great brush and wrote the same big words on the sky. And for very\\n\\nweariness he lay down on a great bank of clouds and soon was sound\\n\\nasleep. As he slept, the cloud grew bigger and bigger and blacker and\\n\\nblacker, and the thunder came nearer and nearer until, all at once,\\n\\nCRASH-CRASH--the cloud seemed torn to pieces and the King leaped to his\\n\\nfeet half-scared to death, even if he was a King. There before him,\\n\\ndarting this way and that way, and up and down, and across-ways, was a\\n\\nswarm of little red-hot creatures that hissed and buzzed and cracked\\n\\nlike the Fourth of July.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who are you?\" he asked in half-fright as he rubbed his eyes, \"and what\\n\\ndo you want?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Messengers, messengers, messengers,\" whispered they all at once, \"and\\n\\nwe have come to serve the King.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What are your names?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We are the Lightning Spirits; sometimes men call us Electricity--\\n\\n\\n\\n    _The swiftest creatures that are known to men,\\n\\n    To carry your messages, a million times ten.\"_\\n\\n\\n\\nThe King charged them gravely and solemnly, as he had done the winds and\\n\\nthe birds before them, that his messengers must be true and faithful and\\n\\nmust keep his secrets. But no matter how great the task nor how heavy\\n\\nthe oaths with which he bound them to be faithful, they were eager, all\\n\\nof them, to serve the King. Only he must build road-ways for them. They\\n\\nhad not wings to fly, and their feet were not accustomed to the highways\\n\\nof the land. They might lose their way. So the King decided to try them.\\n\\nHe called his laborers and ordered them to erect tall poles, and from\\n\\npole to pole to lay slender roadways of wire. Miles and miles of these\\n\\nroadways he built, over the hills and through the valleys. And when all\\n\\nwas complete, he called the spirits to him and whispered to them his\\n\\nsecret messages. Quick as thought they ran over the little roadways,\\n\\nhither and thither, and back again, doing faithfully and well the King\\'s\\n\\nerrands and keeping the King\\'s secrets. They whispered never so much as\\n\\na word of them. So the Earth King called a great assembly, and before\\n\\nthem all appointed the Lightning Spirits to be his trusted messengers\\n\\nfor ever and a day.\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course the winds were very jealous when they heard of it, and they\\n\\ndetermined to get revenge by stealing the messages from the spirits.\\n\\nThey dashed against the wires day after day, trying to break them and\\n\\nget the secrets, but all to no purpose. All they could hear was\\n\\nMUM-MUM-MUM-M-M; and the harder they blew, the louder they heard it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe birds had all along been sorry that they had given away the great\\n\\nsecret, and had been hoping that the King would give them another\\n\\nchance.

She had money besides but little good\\n\\nit did her because she was such an ill-tempered vixen that nobody, not\\n\\neven the poorest laborer, would marry her. Nobody would even work for\\n\\nher, no matter what she paid, for she couldn\\'t open her mouth without\\n\\nscolding, and whenever she scolded she raised her shrill voice until you\\n\\ncould hear it a mile away. The older she grew the worse she became until\\n\\nby the time she was forty she was as sour as vinegar.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow as it always happens in a village, every Sunday afternoon there was\\n\\na dance either at the burgomaster\\'s, or at the tavern. As soon as the\\n\\nbagpipes sounded, the boys all crowded into the room and the girls\\n\\ngathered outside and looked in the windows. Katcha was always the first\\n\\nat the window. The music would strike up and the boys would beckon the\\n\\ngirls to come in and dance, but no one ever beckoned Katcha. Even when\\n\\nshe paid the piper no one ever asked her to dance. Yet she came Sunday\\n\\nafter Sunday just the same.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne Sunday afternoon as she was hurrying to the tavern she thought to\\n\\nherself: \"Here I am getting old and yet I\\'ve never once danced with a\\n\\nboy! Plague take it, to-day I\\'d dance with the devil if he asked me!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was in a fine rage by the time she reached the tavern, where she sat\\n\\ndown near the stove and looked around to see what girls the boys had\\n\\ninvited to dance.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly a stranger in hunter\\'s green came in. He sat down at a table\\n\\nnear Katcha and ordered drink. When the serving maid brought the beer,\\n\\nhe reached over to Katcha and asked her to drink with him. At first she\\n\\nwas much taken back at this attention, then she pursed her lips coyly\\n\\nand pretended to refuse, but finally she accepted.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen they had finished drinking, he pulled a ducat from his pocket,\\n\\ntossed it to the piper, and called out:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Clear the floor, boys! This is for Katcha and me alone!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe boys snickered and the girls giggled, hiding behind each other and\\n\\nstuffing their aprons into their mouths so that Katcha wouldn\\'t hear\\n\\nthem laughing. But Katcha wasn\\'t noticing them at all. Katcha was\\n\\ndancing with a fine young man! If the whole world had been laughing at\\n\\nher, Katcha wouldn\\'t have cared.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe stranger danced with Katcha all afternoon and all evening. Not once\\n\\ndid he dance with any one else. He bought her marzipan and sweet drinks\\n\\nand, when the hour came to go home, he escorted her through the village.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah,\" sighed Katcha when they reached her cottage and it was time to\\n\\npart, \"I wish I could dance with you forever!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said the stranger. \"Come with me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where do you live?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Put your arm around my neck and I\\'ll tell you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nKatcha put both arms about his neck and instantly the man changed into a\\n\\ndevil and flew straight down to hell.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the gates of hell he stopped and knocked.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis comrades came and opened the gates and when they saw that he was\\n\\nexhausted, they tried to take Katcha off his neck. But Katcha held on\\n\\ntight and nothing they could do or say would make her budge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe devil finally had to appear before the Prince of Darkness himself\\n\\nwith Katcha still glued to his neck.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s that thing you\\'ve got around your neck?\" the Prince asked.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the devil told how as he was walking about on earth he had heard\\n\\nKatcha say she would dance with the devil himself if he asked her. \"So I\\n\\nasked her to dance with me,\" the devil said. \"Afterwards just to\\n\\nfrighten her a little I brought her down to hell. And now she won\\'t let\\n\\ngo of me!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Serve you right, you dunce!\" the Prince said. \"How often have I told\\n\\nyou to use common sense when you go wandering around on earth! You might\\n\\nhave known Katcha would never let go of a man once she had him!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I beg your Majesty to make her let go!\" the poor devil implored.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I will not!\" said the Prince. \"You\\'ll have to carry her back to earth\\n\\nyourself and get rid of her as best you can. Perhaps this will be a\\n\\nlesson to you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the devil, very tired and very cross, shambled back to earth with\\n\\nKatcha still clinging to his neck. He tried every way to get her off. He\\n\\npromised her wooded hills and rich meadows if she but let him go. He\\n\\ncajoled her, he cursed her, but all to no avail. Katcha still held on.\\n\\n\\n\\nBreathless and discouraged he came at last to a meadow where a\\n\\nshepherd, wrapped in a great shaggy sheepskin coat, was tending his\\n\\nflocks. The devil transformed himself into an ordinary looking man so\\n\\nthat the shepherd didn\\'t recognize him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hi, there,\" the shepherd said, \"what\\'s that you\\'re carrying?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t ask me,\" the devil said with a sigh. \"I\\'m so worn out I\\'m nearly\\n\\ndead. I was walking yonder not thinking of anything at all when along\\n\\ncomes a woman and jumps on my back and won\\'t let go. I\\'m trying to carry\\n\\nher to the nearest village to get rid of her there, but I don\\'t believe\\n\\nI\\'m able. My legs are giving out.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe shepherd, who was a good-natured chap, said: \"I tell you what: I\\'ll\\n\\nhelp you. I can\\'t leave my sheep long, but I\\'ll carry her halfway.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said the devil, \"I\\'d be very grateful if you did!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the shepherd yelled at Katcha: \"Hi, there, you! Catch hold of me!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Katcha saw that the shepherd was a handsome youth, she let go of\\n\\nthe devil and leapt upon the shepherd\\'s back, catching hold of the\\n\\ncollar of his sheepskin coat.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow the young shepherd soon found that the long shaggy coat and Katcha\\n\\nmade a pretty heavy load for walking. In a few moments he was sick of\\n\\nhis bargain and began casting about for some way of getting rid of\\n\\nKatcha.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently he came to a pond and he thought to himself that he\\'d like to\\n\\nthrow her in. He wondered how he could do it. Perhaps he could manage it\\n\\nby throwing in his greatcoat with her. The coat was so loose that he\\n\\nthought he could slip out of it without Katcha\\'s discovering what he was\\n\\ndoing. Very cautiously he slipped out one arm. Katcha didn\\'t move. He\\n\\nslipped out the other arm. Still Katcha didn\\'t move. He unlooped the\\n\\nfirst button. Katcha noticed nothing. He unlooped the second button.\\n\\nStill Katcha noticed nothing. He unlooped the third button and kerplunk!\\n\\nhe had pitched coat and Katcha and all into the middle of the pond!\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he got back to his sheep, the devil looked at him in amazement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Katcha?\" he gasped.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh,\" the shepherd said, pointing over his shoulder with his thumb, \"I\\n\\ndecided to leave her up yonder in a pond.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My dear friend,\" the devil cried, \"I thank you! You have done me a\\n\\ngreat favor. If it hadn\\'t been for you I might be carrying Katcha till\\n\\ndooms-day. I\\'ll never forget you and some time I\\'ll reward you. As you\\n\\ndon\\'t know who it is you\\'ve helped, I must tell you I\\'m a devil.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWith these words the devil vanished.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment the shepherd was dazed. Then he laughed and said to\\n\\nhimself: \"Well, if they\\'re all as stupid as he is, we ought to be able\\n\\nfor them!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe country where the shepherd lived was ruled over by a dissolute young\\n\\nduke who passed his days in riotous living and his nights in carousing.\\n\\nHe gave over the affairs of state to two governors who were as bad as\\n\\nhe. With extortionate taxes and unjust fines they robbed the people\\n\\nuntil the whole land was crying out against them.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow one day for amusement the duke summoned an astrologer to court and\\n\\nordered him to read in the planets the fate of himself and his two\\n\\ngovernors. When the astrologer had cast a horoscope for each of the\\n\\nthree reprobates, he was greatly disturbed and tried to dissuade the\\n\\nduke from questioning him further.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Such danger,\" he said, \"threatens your life and the lives of your two\\n\\ngovernors that I fear to speak.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Whatever it is,\" said the duke, \"speak. But I warn you to speak the\\n\\ntruth, for if what you say does not come to pass you will forfeit your\\n\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe astrologer bowed and said: \"Hear then, O Duke, what the planets\\n\\nforetell: Before the second quarter of the moon, on such and such a day,\\n\\nat such and such an hour, a devil will come and carry off the two\\n\\ngovernors. At the full of the moon on such and such a day, at such and\\n\\nsuch an hour, the same devil will come for your Highness and carry you\\n\\noff to hell.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe duke pretended to be unconcerned but in his heart he was deeply\\n\\nshaken. The voice of the astrologer sounded to him like the voice of\\n\\njudgment and for the first time conscience began to trouble him.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for the governors, they couldn\\'t eat a bite of food and were carried\\n\\nfrom the palace half dead with fright. They piled their ill-gotten\\n\\nwealth into wagons and rode away to their castles, where they barred all\\n\\nthe doors and windows in order to keep the devil out.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe duke reformed. He gave up his evil ways and corrected the abuses of\\n\\nstate in the hope of averting if possible his cruel fate.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe poor shepherd had no inkling of any of these things. He tended his\\n\\nflocks from day to day and never bothered his head about the happenings\\n\\nin the great world.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly one day the devil appeared before him and said: \"I have come,\\n\\nmy friend, to repay you for your kindness. When the moon is in its first\\n\\nquarter, I was to carry off the former governors of this land because\\n\\nthey robbed the poor and gave the duke evil counsel. However, they\\'re\\n\\nbehaving themselves now so they\\'re to be given another chance. But they\\n\\ndon\\'t know this. Now on such and such a day do you go to the first\\n\\ncastle where a crowd of people will be assembled. When a cry goes up and\\n\\nthe gates open and I come dragging out the governor, do you step up to\\n\\nme and say: \\'What do you mean by this? Get out of here or there\\'ll be\\n\\ntrouble!\\' I\\'ll pretend to be greatly frightened and make off. Then ask\\n\\nthe governor to pay you two bags of gold, and if he haggles just\\n\\nthreaten to call me back. After that go on to the castle of the second\\n\\ngovernor and do the same thing and demand the same pay. I warn you,\\n\\nthough, be prudent with the money and use it only for good. When the\\n\\nmoon is full, I\\'m to carry off the duke himself, for he was so wicked\\n\\nthat he\\'s to have no second chance. So don\\'t try to save him, for if you\\n\\ndo you\\'ll pay for it with your own skin. Don\\'t forget!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe shepherd remembered carefully everything the devil told him. When\\n\\nthe moon was in its first quarter he went to the first castle. A great\\n\\ncrowd of people was gathered outside waiting to see the devil carry away\\n\\nthe governor.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly there was a loud cry of despair, the gates of the castle\\n\\nopened, and there was the devil, as black as night, dragging out the\\n\\ngovernor. He, poor man, was half dead with fright.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe shepherd elbowed his way through the crowd, took the governor by the\\n\\nhand, and pushed the devil roughly aside.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What do you mean by this?\" he shouted. \"Get out of here or there\\'ll be\\n\\ntrouble!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nInstantly the devil fled and the governor fell on his knees before the\\n\\nshepherd and kissed his hands and begged him to state what he wanted in\\n\\nreward. When the shepherd asked for two bags of gold, the governor\\n\\nordered that they be given him without delay.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the shepherd went to the castle of the second governor and went\\n\\nthrough exactly the same performance.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt goes without saying that the duke soon heard of the shepherd, for he\\n\\nhad been anxiously awaiting the fate of the two governors. At once he\\n\\nsent a wagon with four horses to fetch the shepherd to the palace and\\n\\nwhen the shepherd arrived he begged him piteously to rescue him\\n\\nlikewise from the devil\\'s clutches.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Master,\" the shepherd answered, \"I cannot promise you anything. I have\\n\\nto consider my own safety. You have been a great sinner, but if you\\n\\nreally want to reform, if you really want to rule your people justly and\\n\\nkindly and wisely as becomes a true ruler, then indeed I will help you\\n\\neven if I have to suffer hellfire in your place.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe duke declared that with God\\'s help he would mend his ways and the\\n\\nshepherd promised to come back on the fatal day.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith grief and dread the whole country awaited the coming of the full\\n\\nmoon. In the first place the people had greeted the astrologer\\'s\\n\\nprophecy with joy, but since the duke had reformed their feelings for\\n\\nhim had changed.\\n\\n\\n\\nTime sped fast as time does whether joy be coming or sorrow and all too\\n\\nsoon the fatal day arrived.\\n\\n\\n\\nDressed in black and pale with fright, the duke sat expecting the\\n\\narrival of the devil.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly the door flew open and the devil, black as night, stood before\\n\\nhim. He paused a moment and then he said, politely:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Your time has come, Lord Duke, and I am here to get you!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWithout a word the duke arose and followed the devil to the courtyard,\\n\\nwhich was filled with a great multitude of people.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt that moment the shepherd, all out of breath, came pushing his way\\n\\nthrough the crowd, and ran straight at the devil, shouting out:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What do you mean by this? Get out of here or there\\'ll be trouble!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What do _you_ mean?\" whispered the devil. \"Don\\'t you remember what I\\n\\ntold you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hush!\" the shepherd whispered back. \"I don\\'t care anything about the\\n\\nduke. This is to warn you! You know Katcha? She\\'s alive and she\\'s\\n\\nlooking for you!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe instant the devil heard the name of Katcha he turned and fled.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll the people cheered the shepherd, while the shepherd himself laughed\\n\\nin his sleeve to think that he had taken in the devil so easily.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for the duke, he was so grateful to the shepherd that he made him his\\n\\nchief counselor and loved him as a brother. And well he might, for the\\n\\nshepherd was a sensible man and always gave him sound advice.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Ilustration: THE WHITE DOGS OF ARRAN]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 5: From _Czechoslovak Fairy Tales_, by Parker Fillmore.\\n\\nCopyright by Harcourt, Brace & Company.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE WHITE DOGS OF ARRAN[6]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOR a long hour, on that November afternoon, my brother Ted had been\\n\\nstanding at the gate below the ranch house, waiting and waiting, while\\n\\nthe twilight filled the round hollow of the valley as water slowly fills\\n\\na cup. At last the figure of a rider, silhouetted against the\\n\\nrose-colored sky, came into view along the crest of the rocky ridge. The\\n\\nlittle cow pony was loping as swiftly as the rough trail would permit,\\n\\nbut to Ted\\'s impatient eyes it seemed to crawl as slowly as a fly on a\\n\\nwindow pane. Although the horseman looked like a cow puncher, at that\\n\\ndistance, with his slouch hat and big saddle, the eager boy knew that it\\n\\nwas the district doctor making his far rounds over the range. A swift\\n\\nepidemic had been sweeping over Montana, passing from one ranch to\\n\\nanother and leaving much illness and suffering behind. Ted\\'s uncle and\\n\\nthe cousin who was his own age had both been stricken two days before\\n\\nand it seemed that the doctor would never come.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad you are here,\" he said as the doctor\\'s pony, covered with foam\\n\\nand quivering with fatigue, passed through the open gate. \"We have two\\n\\npatients for you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe man nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Fever, I suppose,\" he commented, \"and aching bones, and don\\'t know what\\n\\nto make of themselves because they have never been sick before? I have\\n\\nseen a hundred such cases in the last few days. It is bad at all the\\n\\nranches, but the sheep herders, off in their cabins by themselves, are\\n\\nhit particularly hard.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe slipped from the saddle and strode into the house, leaving Ted to\\n\\ntake the tired pony around to the stables. It was very dark now and\\n\\ngrowing cold, but he felt warm and comforted, somehow, since the doctor\\n\\nhad come. He heard running feet behind him and felt a dog\\'s nose, cold\\n\\nand wet, thrust into his hand. It was Pedro, the giant, six months\\' old\\n\\nwolf hound puppy, long legged and shaggy haired, the pride of Ted\\'s life\\n\\nand the best beloved of all his possessions. The big dog followed his\\n\\nmaster into the stable and sat down, blinking solemnly in the circle of\\n\\nlantern light, while the boy was caring for the doctor\\'s horse and\\n\\nbedding it down. Ted\\'s thoughts were very busy, now with his anxieties\\n\\nabout his uncle, now racing out over the range to wonder how those in\\n\\nthe stricken ranch houses and lonely cabins might be faring. There was\\n\\nthe ranch on Arran Creek--people there were numerous enough to care for\\n\\neach other. It might be worse at Thompson\\'s Crossing, and, oh, how would\\n\\nit be with those shepherds who lived in tiny cottages here and there\\n\\nalong the Big Basin, so far from neighbors that often for months they\\n\\nsaw no other faces than the wooly vacant ones of their thousands of\\n\\nsheep.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was one, a big grizzled Irishman, whom Ted had seen only a few\\n\\ntimes. Nevertheless, he was one of his closest friends. They had met on\\n\\na night when the boy was hunting, and he could remember still how they\\n\\nhad lain together by the tiny camp fire, with the coyotes yelping in the\\n\\ndistance, with the great plain stretching out into the dark, with the\\n\\nslender curl of smoke rising straight upward and the big stars seeming\\n\\nalmost within reach of his hand in the thin air. The lonely Irishman had\\n\\nopened his heart to his new friend and had told him much of his own\\n\\ncountry, so unlike this big bare one, a dear green land where the\\n\\ntumbledown cottages and little fields were crowded together in such\\n\\ncomforting comradeship.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You could open your window of a summer night and give a call to the\\n\\nneighbors,\" he sighed, \"and you needn\\'t to have the voice of the giant\\n\\nFinn McCoul to make them hear. In this place a man could fall sick and\\n\\ndie alone and no one be the wiser.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHis reminiscences had wandered farther and farther until he began to\\n\\ntell the tales and legends familiar in his own countryside, stories of\\n\\nthe \"Little People\" and of Ireland in ancient times. Of them all Ted\\n\\nremembered most clearly the story of the white grayhounds of the King of\\n\\nConnemara, upon which his friend had dwelt long, showing that in spite\\n\\nof its being a thousand years old, it was his favorite tale.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Like those dogs on Arran Creek, they were perhaps,\" the Irishman said,\\n\\n\"only sleeker of coat and swifter of foot, I\\'m thinking.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But they couldn\\'t be faster,\" Ted had objected. \"The Arran dogs can\\n\\ncatch coyotes and jack-rabbits and people have called those the quickest\\n\\nanimals that run.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah,\" returned the other with true Irish logic, \"those Arran dogs are\\n\\nRussian, they tell me, and these I speak of were of Connemara, and what\\n\\ncomes out of Ireland, you may be sure, is faster and fairer than\\n\\nanything else on earth.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAgainst such reasoning Ted had judged it impossible to argue and had\\n\\ndropped into silence and finally into sleep with the voices of the\\n\\ncoyotes and the legend of the lean, white Irish grayhounds still running\\n\\nlike swift water through his dreams.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter that he had visited the lonely shepherd whenever he could find\\n\\ntime to travel so far. Together they had hunted deer and trapped beaver\\n\\nin the foothills above the Big Basin or, when the sheep had to be moved\\n\\nto new pasture, had spent hours in earnest talk, plodding patiently in\\n\\nthe dust after the slow-moving flock. The long habit of silence had\\n\\ntaken deep hold upon the Irishman, but with Ted alone he seemed willing\\n\\nto speak freely. It was on one of these occasions that he had given the\\n\\nboy the image of Saint Christopher, \"For,\" he said, \"you are like to be\\n\\na great roamer and a great traveler from the way you talk, and those who\\n\\ncarry the good Saint Christopher with them, always travel safely.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, as Ted thought of illness and pestilence spreading across the\\n\\nthinly settled state, his first and keenest apprehension was for the\\n\\nsafety of his friend. His work done, he went quickly back to the house\\n\\nwhere the doctor was already standing on the doorstep again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They are not bad cases, either of them,\" he was saying to Ted\\'s aunt.\\n\\n\"If they have good care there is no danger, but if they don\\'t--then\\n\\nHeaven help them, I can\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTed came close and pulled his sleeve.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tell me,\" he questioned quickly, \"Michael Martin isn\\'t sick, is he?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Michael Martin?\" repeated the doctor. \"A big Irishman in the cabin at\\n\\nthe upper edge of Big Basin? Yes, he\\'s down sick as can be, poor fellow,\\n\\nwith no one but a gray old collie dog, about the age of himself, I\\n\\nshould think, to keep him company.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe turned back to give a few last directions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I suppose you are master of the house with your uncle laid up,\" he said\\n\\nto Ted again, \"and I will have to apply to you to lend me a fresh horse\\n\\nso that I can go on.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re never going on to-night?\" exclaimed Ted; \"why, you have been\\n\\nriding for all you were worth, all day!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, and all the night before,\" returned the doctor cheerfully, \"but\\n\\nthis is no time to spare horses or doctors. Good gracious, boy, what\\'s\\n\\nthat?\" For Pedro, tall and white in the dark, standing on his hind legs\\n\\nto insert an inquisitive puppy nose between the doctor\\'s collar and his\\n\\nneck, was an unexpected and startling apparition.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s my dog,\" Ted explained proudly; \"Jim McKenzie, over on Arran\\n\\nCreek, gave him to me; he has a lot of them, you know. Pedro is only\\n\\nhalf grown now, he is going to be a lot bigger when he is a year old.\\n\\nYes, I\\'ll bring you a horse right away, yours couldn\\'t go another mile.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen, a few minutes later, the sound of hoofs came clattering up from\\n\\nthe stables it seemed certain that there were more than four of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s this?\" the doctor inquired, seeing a second horse with\\n\\nsaddlebags and blanket roll strapped in place and observing Ted\\'s boots\\n\\nand riding coat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My aunt and the girls will take care of Uncle,\" the boy replied, \"so I\\n\\nam going out to see Michael Martin. You can tell me what to do for him\\n\\nas we ride up the trail.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThey could feel the sharp wind almost before they began climbing the\\n\\nridge. So far, summer had lingered into November, but the weather was\\n\\nplainly changing now and there had been reports of heavy snowfalls in\\n\\nthe mountains. The stars shone dimly, as though through a veil of mist.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You had better push on as fast as you can,\" advised the doctor as they\\n\\ncame to the parting of their ways. \"When a man is as sick as Michael,\\n\\nwhat ever is to happen, comes quickly.\" His horse jumped and snorted.\\n\\n\"There\\'s that white puppy of yours again. What a ghost he is! He is\\n\\nrather big to take with you to a sick man\\'s cabin.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nPedro had come dashing up the trail behind them, in spite of his having\\n\\nbeen ordered sternly to stay at home. At six months old the sense of\\n\\nobedience is not quite so great as it should be, and the love of going\\n\\non an expedition is irresistible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It would take me forever to drive him home now,\" Ted admitted; \"I will\\n\\ntake him along to Jim McKenzie\\'s and leave him there with his brothers.\\n\\nI can make Arran Creek by breakfast time and ought to get to Michael\\'s\\n\\nnot long after noon. Well, so long!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe stars grew more dim and the wind keener as he rode on through the\\n\\nnight. His pony cantered steadily with the easy rocking-horse motion\\n\\nthat came near to lulling him to sleep. Pedro paddled alongside, his\\n\\nlong legs covering the miles with untiring energy. They stopped at\\n\\nmidnight to drink from the stream they were crossing, to rest a little\\n\\nand to eat some lunch from the saddlebags. Then they pressed on once\\n\\nmore, on and on, until gray and crimson began to show behind the\\n\\nmountains to the eastward, and the big white house of Arran at last\\n\\ncame into sight.\\n\\n\\n\\nJim McKenzie\\'s place was bigger than the ordinary ranch house, for there\\n\\nwere gabled roofs showing through the group of trees, there were tall\\n\\nbarns and a wide fenced paddock where lived the white Russian wolfhounds\\n\\nfor which the Arran ranch was famous. A deep-voiced chorus of welcome\\n\\nwas going up as Ted and Pedro came down the trail. The puppy responded\\n\\njoyfully and went bounding headlong to the foot of the slope to greet\\n\\nhis brothers. It was a beautiful sight to see the band of great dogs,\\n\\ntheir coats like silver in the early morning light, romping together\\n\\nlike a dozen kittens, pursuing each other in circles, checking,\\n\\nwheeling, rolling one another over, leaping back and forth over the low\\n\\nfences that divided the paddock, with the grace and free agility of\\n\\ndeer. Early as it was, Jim McKenzie was walking down to the stables and\\n\\nstopped to greet Ted as, weary and dusty, he rode through the gate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sure we\\'ll keep Pedro,\" he said when he had heard the boy\\'s errand.\\n\\n\"Yes, we\\'ve a good many sick here; I\\'d have sent out on the range myself\\n\\nbut there was nobody to spare. They tell me the herds of sheep are in\\n\\nterrible confusion, and most of the herders are down. Poor old Michael\\n\\nMartin, I hope you get there in time to help him. Turn your horse into\\n\\nthe corral, we\\'ll give you another to go on with. Now come in to\\n\\nbreakfast.\" Ted snatched a hurried meal, threw his saddle upon a fresh\\n\\npony, and set off again. For a long distance he could hear the\\n\\nlamentations of Pedro protesting loudly at the paddock gate. The way,\\n\\nafter he passed Arran Creek, led out into the flat country of the Big\\n\\nBasin with the sagebrush-dotted plain stretching far ahead. It seemed\\n\\nthat he rode endlessly and arrived nowhere, so long was the way and so\\n\\nunchanging the landscape. Once, as he crossed a stream, a deer rose,\\n\\nstamping and snorting among the low bushes, and fled away toward the\\n\\nhills, seeming scarcely to touch the ground as it went. Later, something\\n\\nquick and silent, and looking like a reddish-brown collie, leaped from\\n\\nthe sagebrush and scudded across the trail almost under his horse\\'s\\n\\nfeet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"A coyote, out in the open in daylight,\" he reflected, somewhat\\n\\nstartled. \"It must have been cold up in the mountains to make them so\\n\\nbold. That looks bad for the sheep.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was disturbing also to see how many scattered sheep he was beginning\\n\\nto pass, little bands, solitary ewes with half-grown lambs trotting at\\n\\ntheir heels, adventurous yearlings straying farther and farther from\\n\\ntheir comrades. Once or twice he tried to drive them together, but owing\\n\\nto his haste and his inexperience with their preposterous ways, he had\\n\\nvery little success.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There is going to be bad weather, too,\" he observed as he saw the blue\\n\\nsky disappear beneath an overcast of gray. \"I had better get on to\\n\\nMichael\\'s as fast as I can.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe saw the little mud and log cabin at last, tucked away among some\\n\\nstunted trees near the shoulder of a low ridge. It looked deceivingly\\n\\nnear, yet he rode and rode and could not reach it. White flakes were\\n\\nflying now, fitfully at first, then thicker and thicker until he could\\n\\nscarcely see. His growing misgivings gave place to greater and greater\\n\\nanxiety concerning his friend, while there ran through his mind again\\n\\nand again the doctor\\'s words, \"Whatever is to happen, comes quickly.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was past noon and had begun to seem as though he had been riding\\n\\nforever when he breasted the final slope at last, jumped from his horse,\\n\\nand thundered at the cabin door. The whine of a dog answered him from\\n\\nwithin, and a faint voice, broken but still audible, told him that\\n\\nMichael was alive. The cabin, so it seemed to him as he entered, was a\\n\\ngood ten degrees colder than it was outside. Poor Michael, helpless and\\n\\nshivering on the bunk in the corner, looked like the shrunken ghost of\\n\\nthe giant Irishman he had known before. Ted rekindled the fire, emptied\\n\\nhis saddlebags, piled his extra blankets upon the bed and, with a skill\\n\\nbred of long practice in camp cookery, set about preparing a meal.\\n\\nMichael was so hoarse as to be almost unable to speak and so weak that\\n\\nhis mind wandered in the midst of a sentence, yet all of his thoughts\\n\\nwere on the care of his sheep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"When I felt the sickness coming on me I tried to drive them in,\" he\\n\\nwhispered, \"but they broke and scattered and I fell beside the\\n\\ntrail--they must get in--snow coming--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIn an hour his fever rose again, he tossed and muttered with only\\n\\nfleeting intervals of consciousness. Ted had found food and shelter for\\n\\nhis horse in the sheep shed, and had settled down to his task of anxious\\n\\nwatching. The snow fell faster and faster so that darkness came on by\\n\\nmid-afternoon. He had tried to drive the old collie dog out to herd in\\n\\nthe sheep, but the poor old creature would not leave its master and,\\n\\neven when pushed outside, remained whining beside the door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He couldn\\'t do much anyway,\" sighed Ted as he let him in again. \"How\\n\\nthose coyotes yelp! I wish, after all, that I had brought Pedro.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMichael had heard the coyotes too and was striving feebly to rise from\\n\\nhis bed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I must go out to them, my poor creatures,\" he gasped. \"Those devil\\n\\nbeasts will have driven them over the whole country before morning.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut he fell back, too weak to move farther, and was silent a long time.\\n\\nWhen he did speak it was almost aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"With the cold and the snow, I\\'m thinking there will be worse things\\n\\nabroad this night than just the coyotes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe lay very still while Ted sat beside him, beginning to feel sleepy and\\n\\nblinking at the firelight. Eleven o\\'clock, twelve, one, the slow hands\\n\\nof his watch pointed to the crawling hours. Michael was not asleep but\\n\\nhe said nothing, he was listening too intently. It was after one and the\\n\\nboy might have been dozing, when the old man spoke again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hark,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment Ted could hear nothing save the pat-pat of the snow\\n\\nagainst the window, but the collie dog bristled and growled as he lay\\n\\nupon the hearth and pricked his ears sharply. Then the boy heard it\\n\\ntoo, a faint cry and far off, not the sharp yelping of the coyotes,\\n\\nthough that was ominous enough, but the long hungry howl of a timber\\n\\nwolf. Tears of weakness and terror were running down the Irishman\\'s\\n\\nface.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My poor sheep, I must save them,\" he cried. \"What\\'s the value of a\\n\\nman\\'s life alongside of the creatures that\\'s trusted him. Those\\n\\nmurderers will have every one of them killed for me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTed jumped up quickly and bundled on his coat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where\\'s your rifle, Michael?\" he asked. \"I don\\'t know much about sheep,\\n\\nbut I will do what I can.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The rifle?\" returned Michael doubtfully. \"Now, I had it on my shoulder\\n\\nthe day I went out with the sickness on me, and it is in my mind that I\\n\\ndid not bring it home again. But there is the little gun hanging on the\\n\\nnail; there\\'s no more shells for it but there\\'s two shots still left in\\n\\nthe chamber.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe boy took down the rusty revolver and spun the cylinder with a\\n\\npractised finger.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Two shots is right,\" he said, \"and you have no more shells? Well, two\\n\\nshots may scare a wolf.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIf Michael had been in his proper senses, Ted very well knew, he would\\n\\nnever have permitted, without protest, such an expedition as the boy\\n\\nwas planning. As it was, however, he lay back in his bunk again, his\\n\\nmind wandering off once more into feverish dreams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If it was in the Old Country,\" he muttered, \"the very Little People\\n\\nthemselves would rise up to help a man in such a plight. You could be\\n\\nfeeling the rush of their wings in the air and could hear the cry of the\\n\\nfairy hounds across the hills. America is a good country, but, ah--it\\'s\\n\\nnot the same!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHoping to quiet him, Ted took the little Saint Christopher from his\\n\\npocket and laid it in the sick man\\'s hand. Then he finished strapping\\n\\nhis big boots, opened the door and slipped out quietly. Michael scarcely\\n\\nnoticed his going.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe snow had fallen without drifting much, nor was it yet very deep. He\\n\\nhurried down the slope, not quite knowing what he was to do, thinking\\n\\nthat at least he would gather as many sheep as he could and drive them\\n\\nhomeward. But there were no sheep to be found. Where so many had been\\n\\nscattered that afternoon there was now not one. The whole of the Big\\n\\nBasin seemed suddenly to have emptied of them. Presently, however, he\\n\\nfound a broad trail of trampled snow which he followed, where it led\\n\\nalong a tiny stream at the foot of the bridge. As he turned, he heard\\n\\nagain that long, terrifying howl coming down the wind. The sheep,\\n\\nperverse enough to scatter to the four winds when their master sought to\\n\\ndrive them in, had now, it seemed, gathered of their own will when so\\n\\ngreat a danger threatened. Ted came upon them at last, huddled together\\n\\nin a little ravine where the sparse undergrowth gave some shelter from\\n\\nthe snow. He could just see them in the dim light, their gray compact\\n\\nbodies crowded close, their foolish black faces seeming to look\\n\\npiteously to him for help. They were very quiet, although now and then\\n\\nthey would shift a little, stamp, and move closer. The cry of the wolf\\n\\nwas stilled at last, but not because the fierce marauder was not drawing\\n\\nnearer.\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, as he stood watching, there slipped a swift dark shape over the\\n\\nopposite edge of the hollow and flung itself upon a straggling ewe on\\n\\nthe outskirts of the flock. It was followed by a second silent shadow,\\n\\nand a third. The poor sheep gave only one frantic bleat, then all was\\n\\nstill again save for the sound of a hideous snapping and tearing, of a\\n\\nfurious struggle muffled in the soft depths of the snow. Ted raised the\\n\\nrevolver and took careful aim, he pulled the trigger, but no explosion\\n\\nfollowed. Michael\\'s improvidence in letting his stock dwindle to only\\n\\ntwo cartridges might be counted upon also to have let those two be damp.\\n\\nHelplessly the boy spun the cylinder and snapped the hammer again and\\n\\nagain, but to no purpose.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sheep was down now, with one of the savage hunters standing over it,\\n\\nanother tearing at its throat while the third was slipping along the\\n\\nedge of the flock selecting a fresh victim. Ted\\'s weapon was useless,\\n\\nyet he must do something, he could not stand and see the whole herd\\n\\ndestroyed before his eyes. Perhaps he could frighten them away as one\\n\\ncould coyotes: he was so angry at this senseless, brutal slaughter that\\n\\nhe lost all sense of prudence. He waved his arms up and down and shouted\\n\\nat the top of his lungs. He saw the creatures drop their prey and turn\\n\\nto look up at him. He ran along the slope, still shouting, then, of a\\n\\nsudden, stepped into an unexpected hollow, lost his balance and fell\\n\\nheadlong. One of the wolves left the flock and came creeping swiftly\\n\\ntoward him, its belly dragging in the snow.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis cry must have carried far in the quiet of the night for it was\\n\\nanswered from a great way off. A deep voice broke the stillness and\\n\\nanother, the call of coursing hounds who have winded their quarry but\\n\\nhave not yet found its trail. And mingled with the barking chorus there\\n\\nrose high the joyful yelp of a puppy who seeks his beloved master.\\n\\n\\n\\nTed, slipping in the snow, struggled to his knees and called again and\\n\\nagain. The stealthy, approaching shadow crept a yard nearer, then paused\\n\\nto lift a gray muzzle and sniff the air. The second wolf, with\\n\\nslobbering bloody jaws, turned to listen, the flock of sheep snorted and\\n\\nstamped in the snow.\\n\\n\\n\\nA minute passed, then another. The boy managed to get to his feet. Then\\n\\nacross the edge of the hollow, white against the dark underbrush, he saw\\n\\nthe dogs coming, a line of swift, leaping forms, huge, shaggy and\\n\\nbeautiful, their great voices all giving tongue together. Down the slope\\n\\nthey came like an avalanche, only one separating himself from the others\\n\\nfor a moment to fling himself upon Ted, to lick his face in ecstatic\\n\\ngreeting and to rub a cold nose against his cheek. That nimble puppy\\n\\nnose it was that had lifted the latch of a gate not too securely\\n\\nfastened, and so set the whole pack free. Then Pedro ran to join his\\n\\nbrothers who were sweeping on to battle. Wolfhounds are taught to catch,\\n\\nnot to kill their quarry, but the thirst for blood was in the hearts of\\n\\nthe dogs of Arran that night. There was only a moment of struggle, a\\n\\nfew choking cries, and the fight was over.\\n\\n\\n\\nDay broke next morning, clear and bright, with the chinook blowing, the\\n\\nbig warm wind that melts the snows and lays the white hills bare almost\\n\\nin an hour. Michael Martin, fallen into a proper sleep at last, woke\\n\\nsuddenly and sat up in his bunk. He startled Ted, who, rather stiff and\\n\\nsore from his night\\'s adventures, was kneeling by the fire preparing\\n\\nbreakfast. The boy came quickly to his patient\\'s side to inquire how he\\n\\ndid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s better I am in body,\" the Irishman answered; \"indeed I begin to\\n\\nfeel almost like a whole man again. But--\" he shook his head sadly, \"my\\n\\npoor wits, they\\'re gone away entirely.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMichael sighed deeply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"After you were gone last night,\" he answered, \"even my wandering senses\\n\\nhad an inkling of what a dangerous errand it was, and I got up from my\\n\\nbed and stumbled to the window to call you back. Yes, the sickness has\\n\\nmade me daft entirely, for as sure as I live, I saw the white grayhounds\\n\\nof Connemara go over the hill. But daft or no--\" he sniffed at the odor\\n\\nof frying bacon that rose from the hearth, \"I am going to relish my\\n\\nbreakfast this day. Eh, glory me, if there isn\\'t another of the\\n\\ncreatures now!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Pedro, once more applying a knowing muzzle to the clumsy latch, had\\n\\npushed open the door and stood upon the step, wagging and apologetic,\\n\\nthe morning sun shining behind him. Long-legged and awkward, he stepped\\n\\nover the threshold and came to the bedside to sniff inquisitively at the\\n\\nlittle silver image that lay on the blanket. Michael could never be\\n\\npersuaded to believe otherwise than that Saint Christopher had brought\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: WIND AN\\' WAVE AN\\' WANDHERIN\\' FLAME]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 6: Reprinted by permission of the publishers from _The Pool of\\n\\nStars_, by Cornelia Meigs.

Sure, \\'tis meself had nigh on forgot it\\n\\n     entirely, but when all\\'s quiet I\\'ll be afther tellin\\' it.\")\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHERE was always battlin\\' somewhere, back in those days; an\\' heroes that\\n\\nfought with sword an\\' spear--forged far up an\\' under the rainbow by Len\\n\\nthe Smith, that was mighty in all sorts o\\' wisdom.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow one time he was beatin\\' out a great shield o\\' gold; an\\' \\'twas\\n\\nwrought so cunnin\\' that who turned it over an\\' laid it on the wather\\n\\ncould step on it an\\' sail where he would. An\\' for a device on it he made\\n\\nroses o\\' the fine gold, raised far out from it, as they\\'d been growin\\'\\n\\nright there. Almost they seemed wavin\\' in the wind.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn\\' as he came to sthrikin\\' the last blows, his hand slipped, an\\' his\\n\\ngreat hammer went flyin\\' downward through the air; an\\' his cry o\\'\\n\\ncommand sent ringin\\' afther it was too late to hindher.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow \\'twas about toward sunset, an\\' the waves were beatin\\' high an\\' wild\\n\\nafther storm on the west coast, that Artan, son o\\' Duallach, that was a\\n\\nking\\'s son, was huntin\\' along the coast. All day he\\'d been tryin\\' to\\n\\nkeep from the company o\\' Myrdu, his half-brother, but only by now had he\\n\\nshaken him off; an\\' he was runnin\\' swiftly, for gladness o\\' bein\\' alone\\n\\nwith the breeze an\\' the flyin\\' spray.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust as the sinkin\\' sun touched the sea, he heard the great cryin\\'-out\\n\\no\\' Len, out o\\' the North, an\\' looked up into the deep sky. An\\' there he\\n\\nsaw, whirlin\\' down toward him, somethin\\' first dark an\\' then bright. Not\\n\\na fearin\\' thought was in him; an\\' as it came nigh he sprang with hand\\n\\nstretched out an\\' caught it --just savin\\' it from bein\\' buried in the\\n\\nbeach sand.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe force of its fallin\\' sent him to his knees, but in a breath he was\\n\\non his feet again, lookin\\' at what he held. Sure, \\'twas nothin\\' less\\n\\nthan a great hammer, glowin\\' an\\' darkenin\\' by turns, as there had been\\n\\nlivin\\' fire within it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'n ever are ye, then?\" cried Artan, out o\\' the surprise, never\\n\\nthinkin\\' on gettin\\' an answer. Yet thrue an\\' at once came a whisperin\\'\\n\\nlike wind in pine forests far off--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The hammer o\\' Len.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"An\\' how\\'ll I get ye back to him, not knowin\\' where to find him?\" asked\\n\\nArtan. \"Sure, the winds must rise up an\\' blow me to the end o\\' the\\n\\nrainbow, where he sits, or I\\'ll never get there at all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe words were scarce past his lips when down across the hills came a\\n\\nwarm gust o\\' south wind--the last o\\' the storm--an\\' caught him up, still\\n\\nclingin\\' to the hammer, an\\' swept him upwards till he could see naught\\n\\nfor mist an\\' hurryin\\' clouds. Then came a feelin\\' o\\' sinkin\\', an\\' a\\n\\nsudden jar; an\\' there he was standin\\' on green turf, lookin\\' at white\\n\\nmountains, risin\\' higher nor aught he\\'d seen, an\\' between him an\\' them\\n\\nshimmered the rainbow itself, glowin\\' all colors in the light o\\' sunset.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ay, \\'tis aisy seein\\' where I am,\" laughed Artan, startin\\' toward it\\n\\nbravely.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a while he went on, an\\' at last he came nigh enough to see the\\n\\nmighty shape o\\' Len, standin\\' waitin\\' at his forge. An\\' while night was\\n\\nfast comin\\' on, an\\' the stars showin\\' out in the sky over all, yet the\\n\\nsunfire was still flamin\\' up in his smithy, workin\\' his will at a\\n\\nword.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf fear had had place in the heart of Artan, then was time for it, when\\n\\nhe saw the deep eyes o\\' Len, like dark sea-water in caves, lookin\\' far\\n\\nan\\' through him. But never had that come to him, an\\' without speakin\\'\\n\\nhe raised the hammer toward the sthrong knotted hand that claimed it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Whist, then!\" says Len, graspin\\' it quick for fear the metal was\\n\\ncoolin\\'. \"Say naught till I\\'m done!\" With that he beat an\\' turned the\\n\\nshield, an\\' gave the endin\\' touches to it. Then, with another big shout,\\n\\nhe hung it on the rainbow, flashin\\' an\\' shinin\\' till men on earth below\\n\\nsaw it for Northern Lights in the night sky.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How came ye here in me forge, Artan, son o\\' Duallach?\" he cried.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That I know not,\" spoke out Artan. \"When I held yon hammer in hand, an\\'\\n\\ncried on the wind for blowin\\' me to him that owned it--for no other road\\n\\nthere was for returnin\\' it--the warm blast came out o\\' the south an\\'\\n\\ncaught me up here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ay,\" laughed Len, deep an\\' hearty. \"The winds are at the will o\\' him\\n\\nthat handles it; but too great a power is that to be given careless to\\n\\nmortal man. What reward will ye have, now? Whether gold, or power above\\n\\nother men, or the fairest o\\' maids for yer wife?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the blood reddened the face of Artan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Naught care I for gold,\" says he. \"An\\' power over men should be for him\\n\\nthat wins it fair.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then \\'tis the fairest o\\' maids ye\\'ll be afther wantin\\'?\" asked Len.\\n\\n\"Have ye seen such a one?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nay,\" says Artan. \"Dark are the faces in the house o\\' Duallach, an\\'\\n\\nlittle to me likin\\'.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then shall ye have one fair as day,\" says Len. He turned to where the\\n\\nshield was hangin\\', an\\' from the heart o\\' that same he plucked a rose o\\'\\n\\nthe beaten gold, an\\' gave it to Artan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Cast it in the sea surf at sunrise,\" says he, \"callin\\'\\n\\n\\'Darthuil!\\'--then shall ye have yer reward. But one thing mind. Safely\\n\\nyer own is she not till first lost an\\' won back. When ye know not where\\n\\nto seek aid in searchin\\', cry on me name at the sea-coast, an\\' aid will\\n\\nthere be for ye if ye come not too late--wind, wave, an\\' wandherin\\'\\n\\nflame. Never does Len forget. Hold fast yer rose.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he spoke, again came a gale, chill from the north this time, an\\'\\n\\nwhirled Artan past cloud an\\' above surgin\\' seas, an\\' left him on the\\n\\nhilltop above the beach at the last hour before the dawnin\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuick Artan hastened down the cliff, still graspin\\' the golden rose, an\\'\\n\\nstood where the little small waves curled over the stones, waitin\\' for\\n\\nthe first gleam o\\' the sun to touch the sea. Hours it seemed to him, but\\n\\nminutes it was in truth, before he caught a long breath, raised the\\n\\nrose high in air, an\\' tossed it swift an\\' sure into the snowy crest of a\\n\\ngreen incomin\\' wave.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Darthuil!\" he cried, an\\' the cliff echo made a song of it.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the drops flew upward in the red dawn an\\' the breaker swept in, there\\n\\nby his side stood a maid with the gold o\\' the rose in her hair, an\\' the\\n\\nwhite o\\' sea-foam in her fair skin, an\\' the color o\\' the sunrise in lips\\n\\nan\\' cheek. Blither nor spring, he caught her hand an\\' led her over the\\n\\nhills to the house o\\' Duallach, they two singin\\' for joy o\\' livin\\' as\\n\\nthey went.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow not long had the two been wed (an\\' welcome were they under the roof\\n\\nof Duallach), when Myrdu, that was half-brother to Artan, but older nor\\n\\nhim, came back from far huntin\\', ill-pleased at missin\\' Artan for his\\n\\ncompanion, an\\' for helpin\\' him carry the red deer he\\'d shot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Tis an ill youth,\" says he, \"an\\' will get no good from lyin\\' on the\\n\\ncliff edge an\\' lettin\\' the hunt go by.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nay,\" says Duallach, slow to anger. \"Fair fortune has he won, an\\' the\\n\\nfavor o\\' the gods; an\\' has brought home a bride, fair as the sun at\\n\\nnoon.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen was Myrdu half ragin\\' from bein\\' jealous; but not wishin\\' to show\\n\\nthat same, he called for meat an\\' dhrink to be brought him in the great\\n\\nhall. An\\' Artan, wishin\\' to be friendly like, cried out for Darthuil to\\n\\nserve his brother. Sure, when Myrdu saw her comin\\' toward him--shinin\\'\\n\\namong the dark lasses o\\' Duallach\\'s household like a star in the night\\n\\nsky--fury was in his heart for thinkin\\' that Artan, bein\\' younger nor\\n\\nhim, had won what he had not, an\\' soon he laid plans for stealin\\' her\\n\\nfrom his brother.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Twas not many days before word o\\' this came to the ear o\\' Duallach; an\\'\\n\\nhe, hatin\\' strife, bade Artan an\\' Darthuil take horse an\\' ride swiftly\\n\\nsouthward to the Lough o\\' the Lone Valley, to dwell on the little island\\n\\nin it till evil wishes had passed from the heart o\\' Myrdu. So Artan,\\n\\nmindin\\' what Len had foretold, yet thinkin\\' it wiser not to be afther\\n\\nlosin\\' Darthuil at all, rode away with her on his left hand when Myrdu\\n\\nwas sleepin\\' an\\' not knowin\\' what was bein\\' done.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he roused an\\' found them gone, an\\' that none o\\' the house would say\\n\\nwhither, he was in a fine passion; but he made as if he was afther goin\\'\\n\\nhuntin\\', an\\' took his two fierce hounds an\\' went off to trace the road\\n\\nthey\\'d taken. An\\' sure enough, \\'twas not many hours before he was on\\n\\ntheir path.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow safer would it have been had Artan told Darthuil the full raison why\\n\\nhe was takin\\' her far into the shelter o\\' forest an\\' lough o\\' the\\n\\nwildherness; but she, trustin\\' him, asked naught, thinkin\\' no evil o\\'\\n\\nlivin\\' man. So scarce had Artan left her in the low cabin on the island\\n\\nan\\' gone off to hunt, than Myrdu pushed through the bushes, leavin\\' the\\n\\nhounds on the shore behind, an\\' floated himself out to the island on a\\n\\ncouple o\\' logs lashed with a thong o\\' deer-skin. Ay, but Darthuil was\\n\\nstartled, not dhreamin\\' why he\\'d come.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Tis Artan is hurt, an\\' afther sendin\\' me for ye,\" says Myrdu, lookin\\'\\n\\ndown unaisy like, from not wishin\\' to meet the rare clear eyes o\\' her.\\n\\n\"Come, an\\' I\\'ll take ye where he lies.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNot waitin\\' a moment was Darthuil, then, but hurried doin\\' as she was\\n\\nbid, never thinkin\\' what evil might be in store.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfther a few hours Artan came back through the trees, an\\' game a plenty\\n\\nhe\\'d found. He pulled out his boat o\\' skins, an\\' quick paddled back to\\n\\nthe island. But there he found no Darthuil; no, nor any sign o\\' her save\\n\\nthe little print o\\' her sandal by the wather\\'s edge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen came to his mind the promise o\\' Len. Never darin\\' to waste an hour\\n\\nsearchin\\' by himself, he ferried his horse across to the mainland,\\n\\nmounted, an\\' pushed for the sea. Never once did he stop for restin\\'\\n\\ntill he was standin\\' where the waves beat over him, where he had cried\\n\\non Darthuil, an\\' she had come to him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Len!\" he called. \"Yer aidin\\', Len! Darthuil is stolen from me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThere came a rumblin\\' o\\' thunder, an\\' on the shore stood a great figure,\\n\\nlike a pillar o\\' cloud reachin\\' half to the sky.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Never safe yer own till lost an\\' found, I said,\" came the deep voice.\\n\\n\"Now I give ye wild servants, a wind an\\' a wave an\\' a wandherin\\' flame\\n\\nfor helpin\\' ye to bring her safe again. Mind well that each will obey ye\\n\\nbut once, so call on them only when yer sharpest need comes. When ye\\'ve\\n\\nagain set the feet o\\' Darthuil safe in the hall o\\' Duallach, none can\\n\\ntake her from ye more. Now follow yer love. \\'Tis to the Northland has\\n\\nMyrdu carried her. Let him not pass the White Rocks, or wind an\\' wave\\n\\nan\\' flame will lose power to aid ye. Use yer wit, now, an\\' use it well.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nArtan would have spoken to thank him, but with the last word Len was no\\n\\nmore there; so he mounted again an\\' turned to the north; an\\' behind him\\n\\ncame the wind, whisperin\\' over the grass; an\\' the wave, runnin\\' up the\\n\\nsthream near at hand; an\\' the flame, creepin\\' among dhry leaves, but\\n\\nsettin\\' fire to naught else, its time not bein\\' come.\\n\\n\\n\\nTogether they all thraveled the betther part of a long day, an\\' late on\\n\\nArtan saw dust risin\\' ahead. \\'Twas a cloud that Myrdu had raised to hide\\n\\nthe way he was goin\\', an\\' beyond it he was ridin\\', carryin\\' Darthuil\\n\\nbefore him on his saddle o\\' skins, with the two hounds lopin\\' along\\n\\nbeside to fright her from tryin\\' to escape, an\\' to give warnin\\' of any\\n\\nfollowin\\'; while not many miles ahead were the White Rocks, that he was\\n\\npushin\\' to reach.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn hurried Artan, but his horse was wearied, an\\' little head could he\\n\\nmake. Moreover, the cloud o\\' dust left him uncertain o\\' what was hid. So\\n\\nhe thought well, an\\' chose wind to serve him first.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Go on, an\\' blow the dust far away, whisperin\\' courage to Darthuil the\\n\\nwhile,\" says he. An\\' at once the wind sped far ahead, obeyin\\' his\\n\\ncommand. When the two dogs felt it touch them, they cowered low; but\\n\\nDarthuil took heart, knowin\\' that help was at hand. An\\' the dust was no\\n\\nmore hidin\\' her from Artan, so she waved her hand an\\' called aloud to\\n\\nhim to ride in haste.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen Myrdu, fearin\\' that he might yet lose her, threw a handful o\\' twigs\\n\\nbehind him in the road; an\\' fallin\\' they turned into dead trees,\\n\\nstoppin\\' the way on all sides. But Artan well knew the way to clear his\\n\\npath.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Go forward!\" he cried to the wandherin\\' flame, \"an\\' leave not a trace\\n\\no\\' them!\" As he spoke, the flame swept up high in air, roarin\\' an\\'\\n\\nsmokin\\'; an\\' in half an instant naught remained o\\' the logs but a pile\\n\\no\\' smoldherin\\' ashes. But still was Myrdu fast nearin\\' his goal, an\\' had\\n\\none thing more for helpin\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe dropped a little sharp knife in the roadway; an\\' as it fell, it cut\\n\\ninto the dust, an\\' there opened a wide, terrible chasm, not to be\\n\\ncrossed by horse nor man. Then Artan grew clear desperate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wave!\" he shouted, \"bring Darthuil to me!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nUp then it rose, rollin\\' forward like flood-tide in spring; an\\' it\\n\\nfilled the gulf, an\\' swept away dogs an\\' horse an\\' Myrdu himself, that\\n\\nnone were heard of from that on; but Darthuil it floated gentle like, as\\n\\nshe had been a tuft o\\' thistle-down, back to Artan, waitin\\' for her.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe caught her an\\' clasped her close, an\\' turned his horse, an\\' never\\n\\nhalted till he led her safe into the hall o\\' Duallach, where none might\\n\\nsteal her from him again. An\\' there they lived happy all their lives.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut as for the wind an\\' the wave an\\' the wandherin\\' flame, so sweet an\\'\\n\\nfair was Darthuil that ne\\'er would they go from her to return to Len. To\\n\\nthe last o\\' her life the wind blew soft for her when \\'twas overly hot\\n\\nelsewhere, an\\' clear cool wather flowed up from the ground to save her\\n\\ndhrawin\\' any from the river, an\\' fire burned bright on her hearth\\n\\nwithout need o\\' plenishin\\'; an\\' all that for the love o\\' Darthuil, that\\n\\nwas made by Len out o\\' the foam tossed by the wind from the sea-wave,\\n\\nan\\' the wandherin\\' flame o\\' the sunrise.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: THE KING, THE QUEEN, AND THE BEE]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 7: Reprinted by special permission from _The Sons O\\' Cormac_,\\n\\nby Aldis Dunbar.

But even where the foliage on the trees was so thick that it\\n\\nseemed the sun\\'s rays could not penetrate, it was also hot. Not a breath\\n\\nof air was there to fan the monarch\\'s cheek, and he lay down on the\\n\\nthick grass and gazed through the branches of the trees at the blue sky.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This great heat makes me weary,\" said the King, and in a few minutes he\\n\\nhad quietly fallen into a deep sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll was still in the beautiful garden, except for the sound of a few\\n\\nhumming birds, the twittering of the moths whose many-colored wings\\n\\nlooked more beautiful than ever in the bright sunshine, and the buzzing\\n\\nof the bees. But even these sounds grew still as the fierce rays from\\n\\nthe sky grew hotter until all nature seemed hushed to rest. Only one\\n\\ntiny bee was left moving in the garden. It flew steadily from flower to\\n\\nflower, sipping the honey, until at length it began to feel overcome by\\n\\nthe heat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, dear! I wonder what is the matter with me,\" buzzed the little bee.\\n\\n\"This is the first time I have come out of the hive, and I do feel\\n\\nqueer. I hope I am not going to faint.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe little bee felt giddy, and after flying round and round dizzily for\\n\\na few minutes it fell and dropped right on to King Solomon\\'s nose.\\n\\nImmediately the King awoke with such a start that the little bee was\\n\\nfrightened almost out of its wits and flew straight back to the hive.\\n\\n\\n\\nKing Solomon sat up and looked round to see what it was that had\\n\\nawakened him so rudely. He felt a strange pain at the tip of his nose.\\n\\nHe rubbed it with his royal forefinger, but the pain increased.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttendants came rushing towards him and asked him what was the matter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I must have been stung on the nose by a bee,\" said the King angrily.\\n\\n\"Send for the Lord High Physician and the Keeper of the Court Plaister\\n\\nimmediately. I cannot have a blister on the tip of my nose. To-morrow I\\n\\nam to be visited by the Queen of Sheba, and it will not do to have a\\n\\nswollen nose tied up in a sling.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Lord High Physician came with his many assistants, each carrying a\\n\\nbox of ointment, or lint, or some other preparation which might be\\n\\nrequired. King Solomon\\'s nose, and especially the tip of it, was\\n\\nexamined most carefully through a microscope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is almost nothing,\" said the Lord High Physician reassuringly. \"It\\n\\nis just a tiny sting from a very little bee which did not leave its\\n\\nsting in the wound. It will be healed in an hour or two and the Queen of\\n\\nSheba will not be able to notice that anything at all is the matter\\n\\nto-morrow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But meanwhile it smarts,\" said King Solomon. \"I am seriously annoyed\\n\\nwith the little bee. How dared it sting me, King Solomon, monarch of all\\n\\nliving things on earth, in the air and in the waters. Knows it not that\\n\\nI am its Royal Master to whom all homage and respect is due?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe pain soon ceased, but His Majesty did not like the smell of the\\n\\ngreasy ointment which was put on his nose, and he determined that the\\n\\nbee should be brought before him for trial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Place the impudent little bee under arrest at once,\" he commanded, \"and\\n\\nbring it before me so that I may hear what it has to say.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But I know it not,\" returned the Lord High Chamberlain, to whom the\\n\\ncommand was given.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then summon the Queen bee before me in an hour and bid her bring the\\n\\nculprit,\" answered the monarch. \"Tell her that I shall hold all the bees\\n\\nguilty until the saucy little offender is produced before me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe order was carried to the hive by one of the butterflies in\\n\\nattendance on the King and spread consternation among the bees. Such a\\n\\nbuzzing there was that the butterfly said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Stop making that noise. If the King hears you, it will only make\\n\\nmatters worse.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Queen bee promised to obey King Solomon\\'s command, and in an hour\\n\\nshe made her appearance in state before the great throne. Slowly and\\n\\nwith much pomp, the Queen bee made her way to King Solomon. She was the\\n\\nlargest of the bees and was escorted by a bodyguard of twelve female\\n\\nbees who cleared the way before her, walking backwards and bowing\\n\\nconstantly with their faces to her.\\n\\n\\n\\nKing Solomon was surrounded by all his Court which included living\\n\\nbeings, fairies, demons, spirits, goblins, animals, birds and insects.\\n\\nAll raised their voices in a loud hurrah when His Majesty took his seat\\n\\non the Throne, and a very strange noise the Court made. The lions\\n\\nroared, the serpents hissed, the birds chirped, the fairies sang and the\\n\\ndemons howled. The goblins that had no voices could only grin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Silence!\" cried a herald. \"The Queen bee is requested to stand forth.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nStill attended by her twelve guards, the Queen bee approached the foot\\n\\nof the Throne and made obeisance to King Solomon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I, thy slave, the Queen bee,\" she buzzed, \"am here at thy bidding,\\n\\nmighty ruler, great and wise. Command and thou shalt be obeyed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is well,\" replied Solomon. \"Hast thou brought with thee the culprit,\\n\\nthe bee that did dare to attack my nose with its sting?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have, your Majesty,\" answered the Queen bee. \"It is a young bee that\\n\\nthis day did leave the hive for the first time. It has confessed to me.\\n\\nIt did not attack your Majesty wilfully, but by accident, owing to\\n\\ngiddiness caused by the heat, and it could not have injured your Majesty\\n\\nseriously, because it left not its sting in the wound. Be merciful,\\n\\ngracious King.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Fear not my judgment,\" said the King. \"Bid the bee stand forth.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTremblingly, the little bee stood at the foot of the Throne and bowed\\n\\nthree times to King Solomon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Knowest thou not,\" said the King, \"that I am thy royal master whose\\n\\nperson must be held sacred by all living things?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, gracious Majesty,\" buzzed the bee. \"Thy slave is aware of this. It\\n\\nwas but an accident, and it is the nature of thy slave, the bee, who is\\n\\nin duty bound to obey thy laws, to thrust forth its sting when in\\n\\ndanger. I thought I was in danger when I fell.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So was I, for I was beneath you,\" returned King Solomon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Punish me not,\" pleaded the bee. \"I am but one of your Majesty\\'s\\n\\nsmallest and humblest slaves, but even I may be of service to your\\n\\nMajesty some day.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThese words from the little bee made the whole Court laugh. Even the\\n\\ngoblins which could not speak grinned from ear to ear and rolled their\\n\\nbig eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Silence!\" commanded the King sternly. \"There is naught to laugh at in\\n\\nthe bee\\'s answer. It pleases me well. Go, thou art free. Some day I may\\n\\nneed thee.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe little bee bowed its head three times before the King and flew away,\\n\\nbuzzing happily.\\n\\n\\n\\nNext day it kept quite close to the Palace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I want to see the procession when the Queen of Sheba arrives,\" it\\n\\nsaid, \"and I also must be near the King in case His Majesty may want\\n\\nme.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIn great state, the beautiful Queen of Sheba, followed by hundreds of\\n\\nhandsomely robed attendants, approached King Solomon who was seated on\\n\\nhis Throne, surrounded by all his Court.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Great and mighty King of Israel,\" she said, curtseying low, \"I have\\n\\nheard of thy great wisdom and would fain put it to the test. Hitherto\\n\\nall questions put to thee hast thou answered without difficulty. But I\\n\\nhave sworn to puzzle thy wondrous wisdom with my woman\\'s wit. Be\\n\\nheedful.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Beauteous Queen of Sheba,\" returned King Solomon, rising and bowing in\\n\\nreturn to her curtsey, \"thou art as witty as thou art fair, and if thou\\n\\nart successful in puzzling me, thy triumph shall be duly rewarded. I\\n\\nwill load thee with rich presents and proclaim thy wit and wisdom to the\\n\\nwhole world.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I accept thy challenge,\" replied the Queen, \"and at once.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBehind Her Majesty stood two beautiful girl attendants, each holding a\\n\\nbouquet of flowers. The Queen of Sheba took the flowers, and holding a\\n\\nbouquet in each hand, said to King Solomon:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tell me, thou who art the wisest man on earth, which of these bunches\\n\\nof flowers is real and which artificial.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They are both beautiful and their fragrance delicious in the extreme,\"\\n\\nreplied King Solomon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah,\" said the Queen, \"but only one bunch has fragrance. Which is it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nKing Solomon looked at the flowers. Both bunches looked exactly alike.\\n\\nFrom where he sat, it was impossible to detect any difference. He did\\n\\nnot answer at once, and he knit his brows as if perplexed. The courtiers\\n\\nalso looked troubled. Never before had they seen the King hesitate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is it impossible for your Majesty to answer the question?\" the Queen\\n\\nasked.\\n\\n\\n\\nSolomon shook his head and smiled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Never yet has a problem baffled me,\" he said. \"Your Majesty shall be\\n\\nanswered, and correctly.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And at once,\" said the Queen of Sheba imperiously.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So be it,\" answered King Solomon, gazing thoughtfully round and raising\\n\\nhis magic scepter.\\n\\n\\n\\nImmediately he heard what no one else did, the faint buzzing of the tiny\\n\\nwings of the little bee which had settled on one of the window panes of\\n\\nthe Palace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bid that window be opened,\" he commanded, pointing to it with his\\n\\nscepter, \"and let the bee enter to obey my wish.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe window was promptly opened, and in flew the little bee. Straight\\n\\ntowards the Queen of Sheba it flew, and now its buzzing could be heard\\n\\nby all the courtiers, who eagerly watched its flight through the air.\\n\\nWithout any hesitation, it settled on the bouquet in the Queen\\'s left\\n\\nhand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thou hast my answer, fair Queen of Sheba,\" said King Solomon, rising,\\n\\n\"given to thee by one of the tiniest of my subjects. It has settled on\\n\\nthe flowers that are natural. The bouquet in your right hand is made by\\n\\nhuman hands.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe whole Court applauded the monarch\\'s wisdom in bidding the little bee\\n\\nhelp him out of his difficulty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Your Majesty is indeed the wisest man on earth,\" said the Queen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thanks, my little friend,\" said the King to the bee, and it flew away,\\n\\nbuzzing merrily.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: THE WELL OF THE WORLD\\'S END]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 8: From _Jewish Fairy Tales and Fables,_ by Aunt Naomi. Robert\\n\\nScott, London.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE WELL OF THE WORLD\\'S END[9]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nONCE upon a time, and a very good time it was, though it wasn\\'t in my\\n\\ntime, nor in your time, nor in any one else\\'s time, there was a girl\\n\\nwhose mother had died, and her father married again. And her stepmother\\n\\nhated her because she was more beautiful than herself, and she was very\\n\\ncruel to her. She used to make her do all the servant\\'s work, and never\\n\\nlet her have any peace.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last, one day, the stepmother thought to get rid of her altogether;\\n\\nso she handed her a sieve and said to her: \"Go, fill it at the Well of\\n\\nthe World\\'s End and bring it home to me full, or woe betide you.\" For\\n\\nshe thought she would never be able to find the Well of the World\\'s End,\\n\\nand, if she did, how could she bring home a sieve full of water?\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, the girl started off, and asked every one she met to tell her\\n\\nwhere was the Well of the World\\'s End. But nobody knew, and she didn\\'t\\n\\nknow what to do, when a queer little old woman, all bent double, told\\n\\nher where it was, and how she could get to it. So she did what the old\\n\\nwoman told her, and at last arrived at the Well of the World\\'s End. But\\n\\nwhen she dipped the sieve in the cold, cold water, it all ran out again.\\n\\nShe tried and she tried again, but every time it was the same; and at\\n\\nlast she sat down and cried as if her heart would break.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly she heard a croaking voice, and she looked up and saw a great\\n\\nfrog with goggle eyes looking at her and speaking to her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter, dearie?\" it said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, oh, dear,\" she said, \"my stepmother has sent me all this long\\n\\nway to fill this sieve with water from the Well of the World\\'s End, and\\n\\nI can\\'t fill it no how at all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the frog, \"if you promise me to do whatever I bid you for a\\n\\nwhole night long, I\\'ll tell you how to fill it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the girl agreed, and the frog said:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Stop it with moss and daub it with clay,\\n\\n    And then it will carry the water away\";\\n\\n\\n\\nand then it gave a hop, skip, and a jump, and went flop into the Well of\\n\\nthe World\\'s End.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the girl looked about for some moss, and lined the bottom of the\\n\\nsieve with it, and over that she put some clay, and then she dipped it\\n\\nonce again into the Well of the World\\'s End; and this time the water\\n\\ndidn\\'t run out, and she turned to go away.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust then the frog popped up its head out of the Well of the World\\'s\\n\\nEnd, and said: \"Remember your promise.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All right,\" said the girl; for, thought she, \"what harm can a frog do\\n\\nme?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo she went back to her stepmother, and brought the sieve full of water\\n\\nfrom the Well of the World\\'s End. The stepmother was angry as angry, but\\n\\nshe said nothing at all.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat very evening they heard something tap-tapping at the door low down,\\n\\nand a voice cried out:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Open the door, my hinny, my heart,\\n\\n      Open the door, my own darling;\\n\\n    Mind you the words that you and I spoke,\\n\\n      Down in the meadow, at the World\\'s End Well.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Whatever can that be?\" cried out the stepmother, and the girl had to\\n\\ntell her all about it, and what she had promised the frog.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Girls must keep their promises,\" said the stepmother. \"Go and open the\\n\\ndoor this instant.\" For she was glad the girl would have to obey a nasty\\n\\nfrog.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the girl went and opened the door, and there was the frog from the\\n\\nWell of the World\\'s End. And it hopped, and it hopped, and it jumped,\\n\\ntill it reached the girl, and then it said:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Lift me to your knee, my hinny, my heart;\\n\\n      Lift me to your knee, my own darling;\\n\\n    Remember the words you and I spake,\\n\\n      Down in the meadow by the World\\'s End Well.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the girl didn\\'t like to, till her stepmother said: \"Lift it up this\\n\\ninstant, you hussy! Girls must keep their promises!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo at last she lifted the frog up on to her lap, and it lay there for a\\n\\ntime, till at last it said:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Give me some supper, my hinny, my heart,\\n\\n      Give me some supper, my darling;\\n\\n    Remember the words you and I spake,\\n\\n      In the meadow, by the Well of the World\\'s End.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, she didn\\'t mind doing that, so she got it a bowl of milk and\\n\\nbread, and fed it well. And when the frog had finished, it said:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Go with me to bed, my hinny, my heart,\\n\\n      Go with me to bed, my own darling;\\n\\n    Mind you the words you spake to me,\\n\\n      Down by the cold well, so weary.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut that the girl wouldn\\'t do, till her stepmother said: \"Do what you\\n\\npromised, girl; girls must keep their promises. Do what you\\'re bid, or\\n\\nout you go, you and your froggie.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the girl took the frog with her to bed, and kept it as far away from\\n\\nher as she could. Well, just as the day was beginning to break what\\n\\nshould the frog say but:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Chop off my head, my hinny, my heart,\\n\\n      Chop off my head, my own darling;\\n\\n    Remember the promise you made to me,\\n\\n      Down by the cold well so weary.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAt first the girl wouldn\\'t, for she thought of what the frog had done\\n\\nfor her at the Well of the World\\'s End. But when the frog said the words\\n\\nover again, she went and took an ax and chopped off its head, and lo!\\n\\nand behold, there stood before her a handsome young prince, who told her\\n\\nthat he had been enchanted by a wicked magician, and he could never be\\n\\nunspelled till some girl would do his bidding for a whole night, and\\n\\nchop off his head at the end of it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe stepmother was surprised indeed when she found the young prince\\n\\ninstead of the nasty frog, and she wasn\\'t best pleased, you may be sure,\\n\\nwhen the prince told her that he was going to marry her stepdaughter\\n\\nbecause she had unspelled him. But married they were, and went away to\\n\\nlive in the castle of the king, his father, and all the stepmother had\\n\\nto console her was, that it was all through her that her stepdaughter\\n\\nwas married to a prince.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: WINGS]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 9: From _English Fairy Tales,_ by Joseph Jacobs.

The farmer\\'s daughter\\n\\ncame by and asked, \"What are you blubbering about?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t got any wings,\" cried the peasant girl. \"Oh, I wish I could\\n\\ngrow some wings.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You stupid!\" said the farmer\\'s daughter. \"Of course you haven\\'t got\\n\\nwings. What do you want wings for?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I want to fly up into the sky and sing my little songs there,\" answered\\n\\nthe little peasant girl.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the farmer\\'s daughter was angry, and said again, \"You stupid! How\\n\\ncan you ever expect to grow wings? Your father\\'s only a farm-laborer.\\n\\nThey might grow on me, but not on you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the farmer\\'s daughter had said that, she went away to the well,\\n\\nsprinkled some water on her shoulders, and stood out among the\\n\\nvegetables in the garden, waiting for her wings to sprout. She really\\n\\nbelieved the sun would bring them out quite soon.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut in a little while a merchant\\'s daughter came along the road and\\n\\ncalled out to the girl who was trying to grow wings in the garden, \"What\\n\\nare you doing standing out there, red face?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am growing wings,\" said the farmer\\'s daughter. \"I want to fly.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the merchant\\'s daughter laughed loudly, and cried out, \"You stupid\\n\\nfarm-girl; if you had wings they would only be a weight on your back.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe merchant\\'s daughter thought she knew who was most likely to grow\\n\\nwings. And when she went back to the town where she lived she bought\\n\\nsome olive-oil and rubbed it on her shoulders, and went out into the\\n\\ngarden and waited for her wings to grow.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy and by a young lady of the Court came along, and said to her, \"What\\n\\nare you doing out there, my child?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the tradesman\\'s daughter said that she was growing wings, the young\\n\\nlady\\'s face flushed and she looked quite vexed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s not for you to do,\" she said. \"It is only real ladies who can\\n\\ngrow wings.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd she went on home, and when she got indoors she filled a tub with\\n\\nmilk and bathed herself in it, and then went into her garden and stood\\n\\nin the sun and waited for her wings to come out. Presently a princess\\n\\npassed by the garden, and when she saw the young lady standing there she\\n\\nsent a servant to inquire what she was doing. The servant came back and\\n\\ntold her that as the young lady had wanted to be able to fly she had\\n\\nbathed herself in milk and was waiting for her wings to grow.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe princess laughed scornfully and exclaimed, \"What a foolish girl!\\n\\nShe\\'s giving herself trouble for nothing. No one who is not a princess\\n\\ncan ever grow wings.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe princess turned the matter over in her mind, and when she arrived at\\n\\nher father\\'s palace she went into her chamber, anointed herself with\\n\\nsweet-smelling perfumes, and then went down into the palace garden to\\n\\nwait for her wings to come.\\n\\n\\n\\nVery soon all the young girls in the country round about went out into\\n\\ntheir gardens and stood among the vegetables so that they might get\\n\\nwings.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Fairy of the Wings heard about this strange happening and she flew\\n\\ndown to earth, and, looking at the waiting girls, she said, \"If I give\\n\\nyou all wings and let you all go flying into the sky, who will want to\\n\\nstay at home to cook the porridge and look after the children? I had\\n\\nbetter give wings only to one of you, namely, to her who wanted them\\n\\nfirst of all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo wings grew from the little peasant girl\\'s shoulders, and she was able\\n\\nto fly up into the sky and sing.\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 10: From _The Sweet-Scented Name,_ by Fedor Sologub.

This girl was good as well as pretty. No one had\\n\\never seen her frown or heard her say a cross word, and young and old\\n\\nwere glad when they saw her coming.\\n\\n\\n\\nSnowflower had no relation in the world but a very old grandmother. . . .\\n\\nEvery evening, when the fire was heaped with the sticks she had\\n\\ngathered till it blazed and crackled up the cottage chimney, Dame\\n\\nFrostyface set aside her wheel, and told her a new story. Often did the\\n\\nlittle girl wonder where her grandmother had gathered so many stories,\\n\\nbut she soon learned that. One sunny morning, at the time of the\\n\\nswallows\\' coming, the dame rose up, put on the gray hood and mantle in\\n\\nwhich she carried her yarn to the fairs, and said, \"My child, I am going\\n\\na long journey to visit an aunt of mine, who lives far in the north\\n\\ncountry. I cannot take you with me, because my aunt is the crossest\\n\\nwoman alive, and never liked young people: but the hens will lay eggs\\n\\nfor you; there is barley-meal in the barrel; and, as you have been a\\n\\ngood girl, I\\'ll tell you what to do when you feel lonely. Lay your head\\n\\ngently down on the cushion of the arm-chair, and say, \\'Chair of my\\n\\ngrandmother, tell me a story.\\' It was made by a cunning fairy, who lived\\n\\nin the forest when I was young, and she gave it to me because she knew\\n\\nnobody could keep what they got hold of better. Remember, you must never\\n\\nask a story more than once in the day; and if there be any occasion to\\n\\ntravel, you have only to seat yourself in it, and say, \\'Chair of my\\n\\ngrandmother, take me such a way.\\' It will carry you wherever you wish;\\n\\nbut mind to oil the wheels before you set out, for I have sat on it\\n\\nthese forty years in that same corner.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving said this, Dame Frostyface set forth to see her aunt in the north\\n\\ncountry. Snowflower gathered firing and looked after the hens and cat as\\n\\nusual. She baked herself a cake or two of the barley-meal; but when the\\n\\nevening fell the cottage looked lonely. Then Snowflower remembered her\\n\\ngrandmother\\'s words, and, laying her head gently down, she said, \"Chair\\n\\nof my grandmother, tell me a story.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nScarce were the words spoken, when a clear voice from under the velvet\\n\\ncushion . . . said: _\"Listen to the story of the Christmas Cuckoo!\"_\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Once upon a time there stood in the midst of a bleak moor, in the north\\n\\ncountry, a certain village; all its inhabitants were poor, for their\\n\\nfields were barren, and they had little trade, but the poorest of them\\n\\nall were two brothers called Scrub and Spare, who followed the cobbler\\'s\\n\\ncraft, and had but one stall between them. It was a hut built of clay\\n\\nand wattles. The door was low and always open, for there was no window.\\n\\nThe roof did not entirely keep out the rain, and the only thing\\n\\ncomfortable about it was a wide hearth, for which the brothers could\\n\\nnever find wood enough to make a sufficient fire. There they worked in\\n\\nmost brotherly friendship, though with little encouragement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The people of that village were not extravagant in shoes, and better\\n\\ncobblers than Scrub and Spare might be found. Spiteful people said there\\n\\nwere no shoes so bad that they would not be worse for their mending.\\n\\nNevertheless Scrub and Spare managed to live between their own trade, a\\n\\nsmall barley field, and a cottage garden, till one unlucky day when a\\n\\nnew cobbler arrived in the village. He had lived in the capital city of\\n\\nthe kingdom, and, by his own account, cobbled for the queen and the\\n\\nprincesses. His awls were sharp, his lasts were new; he set up his stall\\n\\nin a neat cottage with two windows. The villagers soon found out that\\n\\none patch of his would wear two of the brothers\\'. In short, all the\\n\\nmending left Scrub and Spare, and went to the new cobbler. The season\\n\\nhad been wet and cold, their barley did not ripen well, and the cabbages\\n\\nnever half closed in the garden. So the brothers were poor that winter,\\n\\nand when Christmas came they had nothing to feast on but a barley loaf,\\n\\na piece of rusty bacon, and some small beer of their own brewing. Worse\\n\\nthan that, the snow was very deep, and they could get no firewood. Their\\n\\nhut stood at the end of the village, beyond it spread the bleak moor,\\n\\nnow all white and silent; but that moor had once been a forest, great\\n\\nroots of old trees were still to be found in it, loosened from the soil\\n\\nand laid bare by the winds and rains--one of these, a rough gnarled log,\\n\\nlay hard by their door, the half of it above the snow, and Spare said to\\n\\nhis brother:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Shall we sit here cold on Christmas while the great root lies yonder?\\n\\nLet us chop it up for firewood, the work will make us warm.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'No,\\' said Scrub; \\'it\\'s not right to chop wood on Christmas; besides,\\n\\nthat root is too hard to be broken with any hatchet.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Hard or not we must have a fire,\\' replied Spare. \\'Come, brother, help\\n\\nme in with it. Poor as we are, there is nobody in the village will have\\n\\nsuch a yule log as ours.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub liked a little grandeur, and in hopes of having a fine yule log,\\n\\nboth brothers strained and strove with all their might till, between\\n\\npulling and pushing, the great old root was safe on the hearth, and\\n\\nbeginning to crackle and blaze with the red embers. In high glee, the\\n\\ncobblers sat down to their beer and bacon. The door was shut, for there\\n\\nwas nothing but cold moonlight and snow outside; but the hut, strewn\\n\\nwith fir boughs, and ornamented with holly, looked cheerful as the ruddy\\n\\nblaze flared up and rejoiced their hearts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Long life and good fortune to ourselves, brother!\\' said Spare. \\'I hope\\n\\nyou will drink that toast, and may we never have a worse fire on\\n\\nChristmas--but what is that?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Spare set down the drinking-horn, and the brothers listened astonished,\\n\\nfor out of the blazing root they heard, \\'Cuckoo! cuckoo!\\' as plain as\\n\\never the spring-bird\\'s voice came over the moor on a May morning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'It is something bad,\\' said Scrub, terribly frightened.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'May be not,\\' said Spare; and out of the deep hole at the side which\\n\\nthe fire had not reached flew a large gray cuckoo, and lit on the table\\n\\nbefore them. Much as the cobblers had been surprised, they were still\\n\\nmore so when it said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Good gentlemen, what season is this?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'It\\'s Christmas,\\' said Spare.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Then a merry Christmas to you!\\' said the cuckoo. \\'I went to sleep in\\n\\nthe hollow of that old root one evening last summer, and never woke till\\n\\nthe heat of your fire made me think it was summer again; but now since\\n\\nyou have burned my lodging, let me stay in your hut till the spring\\n\\ncomes around--I only want a hole to sleep in, and when I go on my\\n\\ntravels next summer be assured I will bring you some present for your\\n\\ntrouble.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Stay, and welcome,\\' said Spare, while Scrub sat wondering if it were\\n\\nsomething bad or not; \\'I\\'ll make you a good warm hole in the thatch. But\\n\\nyou must be hungry after that long sleep?--here is a slice of barley\\n\\nbread. Come help us to keep Christmas!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The cuckoo ate up the slice, drank water from the brown jug, for he\\n\\nwould take no beer, and flew into a snug hole which Spare scooped for\\n\\nhim in the thatch of the hut.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub said he was afraid it wouldn\\'t be lucky; but as it slept on and\\n\\nthe days passed he forgot his fears. So the snow melted, the heavy rains\\n\\ncame, the cold grew less, the days lengthened, and one sunny morning the\\n\\nbrothers were awakened by the cuckoo shouting its own cry to let them\\n\\nknow the spring had come.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Now I\\'m going on my travels,\\' said the bird, \\'over the world to tell\\n\\nmen of the spring. There is no country where trees bud or flowers bloom,\\n\\nthat I will not cry in before the year goes round. Give me another slice\\n\\nof barley bread to keep me on my journey, and tell me what present I\\n\\nshall bring you at the twelvemonth\\'s end.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub would have been angry with his brother for cutting so large a\\n\\nslice, their store of barley-meal being low; but his mind was occupied\\n\\nwith what present would be most prudent to ask: at length a lucky\\n\\nthought struck him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Good master cuckoo,\\' said he, \\'if a great traveler who sees all the\\n\\nworld like you, could know of any place where diamonds or pearls were to\\n\\nbe found, one of a tolerable size brought in your beak would help such\\n\\npoor men as my brother and I to provide something better than barley\\n\\nbread for your next entertainment.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'I know nothing of diamonds or pearls,\\' said the cuckoo; \\'they are in\\n\\nthe hearts of rocks and the sands of rivers. My knowledge is only of\\n\\nthat which grows on the earth. But there are two trees hard by the well\\n\\nthat lies at the world\\'s end--one of them is called the golden tree, for\\n\\nits leaves are all of beaten gold: every winter they fall into the well\\n\\nwith a sound like scattered coin and I know not what becomes of them. As\\n\\nfor the other, it is always green like a laurel. Some call it the wise,\\n\\nand some the merry tree. Its leaves never fall, but they that get one of\\n\\nthem keep a blithe heart in spite of all misfortunes, and can make\\n\\nthemselves as merry in a hut as in a palace.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Good master cuckoo, bring me a leaf off that tree,\\' cried Spare.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Now, brother, don\\'t be a fool!\\' said Scrub. \\'Think of the leaves of\\n\\nbeaten gold! Dear master cuckoo, bring me one of them!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Before another word could be spoken, the cuckoo had flown out of the\\n\\nopen door, and was shouting its spring cry over moor and meadow. The\\n\\nbrothers were poorer than ever that year; nobody would send them a\\n\\nsingle shoe to mend. The new cobbler said, in scorn, they should come to\\n\\nbe his apprentices; and Scrub and Spare would have left the village but\\n\\nfor their barley field, their cabbage garden, and a certain maid called\\n\\nFairfeather, whom both the cobblers had courted for seven years without\\n\\neven knowing which she meant to favor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sometimes Fairfeather seemed inclined to Scrub, sometimes she smiled on\\n\\nSpare; but the brothers never disputed for that. They sowed their\\n\\nbarley, planted their cabbage, and now that their trade was gone, worked\\n\\nin the rich villagers\\' fields to make out a scanty living. So the\\n\\nseasons came and passed: spring, summer, harvest, and winter followed\\n\\neach other as they have done from the beginning. At the end of the\\n\\nlatter, Scrub and Spare had grown so poor and ragged that Fairfeather\\n\\nthought them beneath her notice. Old neighbors forgot to invite them to\\n\\nwedding feasts or merrymaking; and they thought the cuckoo had forgotten\\n\\nthem too, when at daybreak, on the first of April, they heard a hard\\n\\nbeak knocking at their door, and a voice crying:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Cuckoo! cuckoo! Let me in with my presents.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Spare ran to open the door, and in came the cuckoo, carrying on one\\n\\nside of his bill a golden leaf larger than that of any tree in the north\\n\\ncountry; and in the other, one like that of the common laurel, only it\\n\\nhad a fresher green.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Here,\\' it said, giving the gold to Scrub and the green to Spare, \\'it\\n\\nis a long carriage from the world\\'s end. Give me a slice of barley\\n\\nbread, for I must tell the north country that the spring has come.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub did not grudge the thickness of that slice, though it was cut\\n\\nfrom their last loaf. So much gold had never been in the cobbler\\'s hands\\n\\nbefore, and he could not help exulting over his brother.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'See the wisdom of my choice!\\' he said, holding up the large leaf of\\n\\ngold. \\'As for yours, as good might be plucked from any hedge. I wonder a\\n\\nsensible bird would carry the like so far.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Good master cobbler,\\' cried the cuckoo, finishing the slice, \\'your\\n\\nconclusions are more hasty than courteous. If your brother be\\n\\ndisappointed this time, I go on the same journey every year, and for\\n\\nyour hospitable entertainment will think it no trouble to bring each of\\n\\nyou whichever leaf you desire.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Darling cuckoo!\\' cried Scrub, \\'bring me a golden one;\\' and Spare,\\n\\nlooking up from the green leaf on which he gazed as though it were a\\n\\ncrown-jewel, said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Be sure to bring me one from the merry tree,\\' and away flew the\\n\\ncuckoo.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'This is the Feast of All Fools, and it ought to be your birthday,\\'\\n\\nsaid Scrub. \\'Did ever man fling away such an opportunity of getting\\n\\nrich! Much good your merry leaves will do in the midst of rags and\\n\\npoverty!\\' So he went on, but Spare laughed at him, and answered with\\n\\nquaint old proverbs concerning the cares that come with gold, till\\n\\nScrub, at length getting angry, vowed his brother was not fit to live\\n\\nwith a respectable man; and, taking his lasts, his awls, and his golden\\n\\nleaf, he left the wattle hut, and went to tell the villagers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They were astonished at the folly of Spare and charmed with Scrub\\'s\\n\\ngood sense, particularly when he showed them the golden leaf, and told\\n\\nthat the cuckoo would bring him one every spring. The new cobbler\\n\\nimmediately took him into partnership; the greatest people sent him\\n\\ntheir shoes to mend; Fairfeather smiled graciously upon him, and in the\\n\\ncourse of that summer they were married, with a grand wedding feast, at\\n\\nwhich the whole village danced, except Spare, who was not invited,\\n\\nbecause the bride could not bear his low-mindedness, and his brother\\n\\nthought him a disgrace to the family.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Indeed, all who heard the story concluded that Spare must be mad, and\\n\\nnobody would associate with him but a lame tinker, a beggar-boy, and a\\n\\npoor woman reputed to be a witch because she was old and ugly. As for\\n\\nScrub, he established himself with Fairfeather in a cottage close by\\n\\nthat of the new cobbler, and quite as fine. There he mended shoes to\\n\\neverybody\\'s satisfaction, had a scarlet coat for holidays, and a fat\\n\\ngoose for dinner every wedding-day. Fairfeather, too, had a crimson gown\\n\\nand fine blue ribands; but neither she nor Scrub were content, for to\\n\\nbuy this grandeur the golden leaf had to be broken and parted with piece\\n\\nby piece, so the last morsel was gone before the cuckoo came with\\n\\nanother.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Spare lived on in the old hut, and worked in the cabbage garden. (Scrub\\n\\nhad got the barley field because he was the eldest.) Every day his coat\\n\\ngrew more ragged, and the hut more weatherbeaten; but people remarked\\n\\nthat he never looked sad nor sour; and the wonder was, that from the\\n\\ntime they began to keep his company, the tinker grew kinder to the poor\\n\\nass with which he traveled the country, the beggar-boy kept out of\\n\\nmischief, and the old woman was never cross to her cat or angry with the\\n\\nchildren.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Every first of April the cuckoo came tapping at their doors with the\\n\\ngolden leaf to Scrub and the green to Spare. Fairfeather would have\\n\\nentertained him nobly with wheaten bread and honey, for she had some\\n\\nnotion of persuading him to bring two gold leaves instead of one; but\\n\\nthe cuckoo flew away to eat barley bread with Spare, saying he was not\\n\\nfit company for fine people, and liked the old hut where he slept so\\n\\nsnugly from Christmas till spring.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub spent the golden leaves, and Spare kept the merry ones; and I\\n\\nknow not how many years passed in this manner, when a certain great\\n\\nlord, who owned that village, came to the neighborhood. His castle stood\\n\\non the moor. It was ancient and strong, with high towers and a deep\\n\\nmoat. All the country, as far as one could see from the highest turret,\\n\\nbelonged to its lord; but he had not been there for twenty years, and\\n\\nwould not have come then, only he was melancholy. The cause of his grief\\n\\nwas that he had been prime-minister at court, and in high favor, till\\n\\nsomebody told the crown-prince that he had spoken disrespectfully\\n\\nconcerning the turning out of his royal highness\\'s toes, and the king\\n\\nthat he did not lay on taxes enough, whereon the north country lord was\\n\\nturned out of office, and banished to his own estate. There he lived for\\n\\nsome weeks in very bad temper. The servants said nothing would please\\n\\nhim, and the villagers put on their worst clothes lest he should raise\\n\\ntheir rents; but one day in the harvest time his lordship chanced to\\n\\nmeet Spare gathering water cresses at a meadow stream, and fell into\\n\\ntalk with the cobbler.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How it was nobody could tell, but from the hour of that discourse the\\n\\ngreat lord cast away his melancholy: he forgot his lost office and his\\n\\ncourt enemies, the king\\'s taxes and the crown-prince\\'s toes, and went\\n\\nabout with a noble train hunting, fishing, and making merry in his hall,\\n\\nwhere all travelers were entertained and all the poor were welcome. This\\n\\nstrange story spread through the north country, and great company came\\n\\nto the cobbler\\'s hut--rich men who had lost their money, poor men who\\n\\nhad lost their friends, beauties who had grown old, wits who had gone\\n\\nout of fashion, all came to talk with Spare, and whatever their troubles\\n\\nhad been, all went home merry. The rich gave him presents, the poor gave\\n\\nhim thanks. Spare\\'s coat ceased to be ragged, he had bacon with his\\n\\ncabbage, and the villagers began to think there was some sense in him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"By this time his fame had reached the capital city, and even the court.\\n\\nThere were a great many discontented people there besides the king, who\\n\\nhad lately fallen into ill-humor because a neighboring princess, with\\n\\nseven islands for her dowry, would not marry his eldest son. So a royal\\n\\nmessenger was sent to Spare, with a velvet mantle, a diamond ring, and a\\n\\ncommand that he should repair to court immediately.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'To-morrow is the first of April,\\' said Spare, \\'and I will go with you\\n\\ntwo hours after sunrise.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The messenger lodged all night at the castle, and the cuckoo came at\\n\\nsunrise with the merry leaf.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Court is a fine place,\\' he said when the cobbler told him he was\\n\\ngoing; \\'but I cannot come there, they would lay snares and catch me; so\\n\\nbe careful of the leaves I have brought you, and give me a farewell\\n\\nslice of barley bread.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Spare was sorry to part with the cuckoo, little as he had of his\\n\\ncompany; but he gave him a slice which would have broken Scrub\\'s heart\\n\\nin former times, it was so thick and large; and having sewed up the\\n\\nleaves in the lining of his leather doublet, he set out with the\\n\\nmessenger on his way to court.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"His coming caused great surprise there. Everybody wondered what the\\n\\nking could see in such a common-looking man; but scarce had his majesty\\n\\nconversed with him half an hour, when the princess and her seven islands\\n\\nwere forgotten, and orders given that a feast for all comers should be\\n\\nspread in the banquet hall. The princes of the blood, the great lords\\n\\nand ladies, ministers of state, and judges of the land, after that\\n\\ndiscoursed with Spare, and the more they talked the lighter grew their\\n\\nhearts, so that such changes had never been seen at court. The lords\\n\\nforgot their spites and the ladies their envies, the princes and\\n\\nministers made friends among themselves, and the judges showed no favor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"As for Spare, he had a Chamber assigned him in the palace, and a seat\\n\\nat the king\\'s table; one sent him rich robes and another costly jewels;\\n\\nbut in the midst of all his grandeur he still wore the leathern doublet,\\n\\nwhich the palace servants thought remarkably mean. One day the king\\'s\\n\\nattention being drawn to it by the chief page, his majesty inquired why\\n\\nSpare didn\\'t give it to a beggar. But the cobbler answered:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'High and mighty monarch, this doublet was with me before silk and\\n\\nvelvet came--I find it easier to wear than the court cut; moreover, it\\n\\nserves to keep me humble, by recalling the days when it was my holiday\\n\\ngarment.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The king thought this a wise speech, and commanded that no one should\\n\\nfind fault with the leathern doublet. So things went, till tidings of\\n\\nhis brother\\'s good fortune reached Scrub in the moorland cottage on\\n\\nanother first of April, when the cuckoo came with two golden leaves,\\n\\nbecause he had none to carry for Spare.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Think of that!\\' said Fairfeather. \\'Here we are spending our lives in\\n\\nthis humdrum place, and Spare making his fortune at court with two or\\n\\nthree paltry green leaves! What would they say to our golden ones? Let\\n\\nus pack up and make our way to the king\\'s palace; I\\'m sure he will make\\n\\nyou a lord and me a lady of honor, not to speak of all the fine clothes\\n\\nand presents we shall have.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub thought this excellent reasoning, and their packing up began: but\\n\\nit was soon found that the cottage contained few things fit for carrying\\n\\nto court. Fairfeather could not think of her wooden bowls, spoons, and\\n\\ntrenchers being seen there. Scrub considered his lasts and awls better\\n\\nleft behind, as without them, he concluded, no one would suspect him of\\n\\nbeing a cobbler. So putting on their holiday clothes, Fairfeather took\\n\\nher looking-glass and Scrub his drinking horn, which happened to have a\\n\\nvery thin rim of silver, and each carrying a golden leaf carefully\\n\\nwrapped up that none might see it till they reached the palace, the pair\\n\\nset out in great expectation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How far Scrub and Fairfeather journeyed I cannot say, but when the sun\\n\\nwas high and warm at noon, they came into a wood both tired and hungry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'If I had known it was so far to court,\\' said Scrub, \\'I would have\\n\\nbrought the end of that barley loaf which we left in the cupboard.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Husband,\\' said Fairfeather, \\'you shouldn\\'t have such mean thoughts:\\n\\nhow could one eat barley bread on the way to a palace? Let us rest\\n\\nourselves under this tree, and look at our golden leaves to see if they\\n\\nare safe.\\' In looking at the leaves, and talking of their fine\\n\\nprospects, Scrub and Fairfeather did not perceive that a very thin old\\n\\nwoman had slipped from behind the tree, with a long staff in her hand\\n\\nand a great wallet by her side.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Noble lord and lady,\\' she said, \\'for I know ye are such by your\\n\\nvoices, though my eyes are dim and my hearing none of the sharpest, will\\n\\nye condescend to tell me where I may find some water to mix a bottle of\\n\\nmead which I carry in my wallet, because it is too strong for me?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"As the old woman spoke, she pulled out a large wooden bottle such as\\n\\nshepherds used in the ancient times, corked with leaves rolled together,\\n\\nand having a small wooden cup hanging from its handle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Perhaps ye will do me the favor to taste,\\' she said. \\'It is only made\\n\\nof the best honey. I have also cream cheese, and a wheaten loaf here, if\\n\\nsuch honorable persons as you would eat the like.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub and Fairfeather became very condescending after this speech. They\\n\\nwere now sure that there must be some appearance of nobility about them;\\n\\nbesides, they were very hungry, and having hastily wrapped up the golden\\n\\nleaves, they assured the old woman they were not at all proud,\\n\\nnotwithstanding the lands and castles they had left behind them in the\\n\\nnorth country, and would willingly help to lighten the wallet. The old\\n\\nwoman could scarcely be persuaded to sit down for pure humility, but at\\n\\nlength she did, and before the wallet was half empty, Scrub and\\n\\nFairfeather firmly believed that there must be something remarkably\\n\\nnoble-looking about them. This was not entirely owing to her ingenious\\n\\ndiscourse. The old woman was a wood-witch; her name was Buttertongue;\\n\\nand all her time was spent in making mead, which, being boiled with\\n\\ncurious herbs and spells, had the power of making all who drank it fall\\n\\nasleep and dream with their eyes open. She had two dwarfs of sons; one\\n\\nwas named Spy, and the other Pounce. Wherever their mother went they\\n\\nwere not far behind; and whoever tasted her mead was sure to be robbed\\n\\nby the dwarfs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub and Fairfeather sat leaning against the old tree. The cobbler had\\n\\na lump of cheese in his hand; his wife held fast a hunk of bread. Their\\n\\neyes and mouths were both open, but they were dreaming of great grandeur\\n\\nat court, when the old woman raised her shrill voice--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'What ho, my sons! come here and carry home the harvest.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No sooner had she spoken, than the two little dwarfs darted out of the\\n\\nneighboring thicket.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Idle boys!\\' cried the mother, \\'what have ye done to-day to help our\\n\\nliving?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'I have been to the city,\\' said Spy, \\'and could see nothing. These are\\n\\nhard times for us--everybody minds their business so contentedly since\\n\\nthat cobbler came; but here is a leathern doublet which his page threw\\n\\nout of the window; it\\'s of no use, but I brought it to let you see I was\\n\\nnot idle.\\' And he tossed down Spare\\'s doublet, with the merry leaves in\\n\\nit, which he had carried like a bundle on his little back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"To explain how Spy came by it, I must tell you that the forest was not\\n\\nfar from the great city where Spare lived in such esteem. All things had\\n\\ngone well with the cobbler till the king thought that it was quite\\n\\nunbecoming to see such a worthy man without a servant. His majesty,\\n\\ntherefore, to let all men understand his royal favor toward Spare,\\n\\nappointed one of his own pages to wait upon him. The name of this youth\\n\\nwas Tinseltoes, and, though he was the seventh of the king\\'s pages,\\n\\nnobody in all the court had grander notions. Nothing could please him\\n\\nthat had not gold or silver about it, and his grandmother feared he\\n\\nwould hang himself for being appointed page to a cobbler. As for Spare,\\n\\nif anything could have troubled him, this token of his majesty\\'s\\n\\nkindness would have done it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The honest man had been so used to serve himself that the page was\\n\\nalways in the way, but his merry leaves came to his assistance; and, to\\n\\nthe great surprise of his grandmother, Tinseltoes took wonderfully to\\n\\nthe new service. Some said it was because Spare gave him nothing to do\\n\\nbut play at bowls all day on the palace-green. Yet one thing grieved the\\n\\nheart of Tinseltoes, and that was his master\\'s leathern doublet, but for\\n\\nit he was persuaded people would never remember that Spare had been a\\n\\ncobbler, and the page took a great deal of pains to let him see how\\n\\nunfashionable it was at court; but Spare answered Tinseltoes as he had\\n\\ndone the king, and at last, finding nothing better would do, the page\\n\\ngot up one fine morning earlier than his master, and tossed the leathern\\n\\ndoublet out of the back window into a certain lane where Spy found it,\\n\\nand brought it to his mother.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'That nasty thing!\\' said the old woman; \\'where is the good in it?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"By this time, Pounce had taken everything of value from Scrub and\\n\\nFairfeather--the looking-glass, the silver-rimmed horn, the husband\\'s\\n\\nscarlet coat, the wife\\'s gay mantle, and, above all, the golden leaves,\\n\\nwhich so rejoiced old Buttertongue and her sons, that they threw the\\n\\nleathern doublet over the sleeping cobbler for a jest, and went off to\\n\\ntheir hut in the heart of the forest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The sun was going down when Scrub and Fairfeather awoke from dreaming\\n\\nthat they had been made a lord and a lady, and sat clothed in silk and\\n\\nvelvet, feasting with the king in his palace-hall. It was a great\\n\\ndisappointment to find their golden leaves and all their best things\\n\\ngone. Scrub tore his hair, and vowed to take the old woman\\'s life, while\\n\\nFairfeather lamented sore; but Scrub, feeling cold for want of his coat,\\n\\nput on the leathern doublet without asking or caring whence it came.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scarcely was it buttoned on when a change came over him; he addressed\\n\\nsuch merry discourse to Fairfeather, that, instead of lamentations, she\\n\\nmade the wood ring with laughter. Both busied themselves in getting up a\\n\\nhut of boughs, in which Scrub kindled a fire with a flint and steel,\\n\\nwhich, together with his pipe, he had brought unknown to Fairfeather,\\n\\nwho had told him the like was never heard of at court. Then they found a\\n\\npheasant\\'s nest at the root of an old oak, made a meal of roasted eggs,\\n\\nand went to sleep on a heap of long green grass which they had gathered,\\n\\nwith nightingales singing all night long in the old trees about them. So\\n\\nit happened that Scrub and Fairfeather stayed day after day in the\\n\\nforest, making their hut larger and more comfortable against the winter,\\n\\nliving on wild birds\\' eggs and berries, and never thinking of their lost\\n\\ngolden leaves, or their journey to court.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"In the meantime Spare had got up and missed his doublet. Tinseltoes, of\\n\\ncourse, said he knew nothing about it. The whole palace was searched,\\n\\nand every servant questioned, till all the court wondered why such a\\n\\nfuss was made about an old leathern doublet. That very day things came\\n\\nback to their old fashion. Quarrels began among the lords, and\\n\\njealousies among the ladies. The king said his subjects did not pay him\\n\\nhalf enough taxes, the queen wanted more jewels, the servants took to\\n\\ntheir old bickerings and got up some new ones. Spare found himself\\n\\ngetting wonderfully dull, and very much out of place: nobles began to\\n\\nask what business a cobbler had at the king\\'s table, and his majesty\\n\\nordered the palace chronicles to be searched for a precedent. The\\n\\ncobbler was too wise to tell all he had lost with that doublet, but\\n\\nbeing by this time somewhat familiar with court customs, he proclaimed a\\n\\nreward of fifty gold pieces to any who would bring him news concerning\\n\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scarcely was this made known in the city, when the gates and outer\\n\\ncourts of the palace were filled by men, women, and children, some\\n\\nbringing leathern doublets of every cut and color; some with tales of\\n\\nwhat they had heard and seen in their walks about the neighborhood; and\\n\\nso much news concerning all sorts of great people came out of these\\n\\nstories, that lords and ladies ran to the king with complaints of Spare\\n\\nas a speaker of slander; and his majesty, being now satisfied that there\\n\\nwas no example in all the palace records of such a retainer, issued a\\n\\ndecree banishing the cobbler for ever from court, and confiscating all\\n\\nhis goods in favor of Tinseltoes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That royal edict was scarcely published before the page was in full\\n\\npossession of his rich chamber, his costly garments, and all the\\n\\npresents the courtiers had given him; while Spare, having no longer the\\n\\nfifty pieces of gold to give, was glad to make his escape out of the\\n\\nback window, for fear of the nobles, who vowed to be revenged on him,\\n\\nand the crowd, who were prepared to stone him for cheating them about\\n\\nhis doublet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The window from which Spare let himself down with a strong rope, was\\n\\nthat from which Tinseltoes had tossed the doublet, and as the cobbler\\n\\ncame down late in the twilight, a poor woodman, with a heavy load of\\n\\nfagots, stopped and stared at him in great astonishment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'What\\'s the matter, friend?\\' said Spare. \\'Did you never see a man\\n\\ncoming down from a back window before?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Why,\\' said the woodman, \\'the last morning I passed here a leathern\\n\\ndoublet came out of that very window, and I\\'ll be bound you are the\\n\\nowner of it.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'That I am, friend,\\' said the cobbler. \\'Can you tell me which way that\\n\\ndoublet went?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'As I walked on,\\' said the woodman, \\'a dwarf, called Spy, bundled it up\\n\\nand ran off to his mother in the forest.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Honest friend,\\' said Spare, taking off the last of his fine clothes (a\\n\\ngrass-green mantle edged with gold), I\\'ll give you this if you will\\n\\nfollow the dwarf, and bring me back my doublet.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'It would not be good to carry fagots in,\\' said the woodman. \\'But if\\n\\nyou want back your doublet, the road to the forest lies at the end of\\n\\nthis lane,\\' and he trudged away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Determined to find his doublet, and sure that neither crowd nor\\n\\ncourtiers could catch him in the forest, Spare went on his way, and was\\n\\nsoon among the tall trees; but neither hut nor dwarf could he see.\\n\\nMoreover, the night came on; the wood was dark and tangled, but here and\\n\\nthere the moon shone through its alleys, the great owls flitted about,\\n\\nand the nightingales sang. So he went on, hoping to find some place of\\n\\nshelter. At last the red light of a fire, gleaming through a thicket,\\n\\nled him to the door of a low hut. It stood half open, as if there was\\n\\nnothing to fear, and within he saw his brother Scrub snoring loudly on a\\n\\nbed of grass, at the foot of which lay his own leathern doublet; while\\n\\nFairfeather, in a kirtle made of plaited rushes, sat roasting pheasants\\'\\n\\neggs by the fire.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Good evening, mistress,\\' said Spare, stepping in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The blaze shone on him, but so changed was her brother-in-law with his\\n\\ncourt-life, that Fairfeather did not know him, and she answered far\\n\\nmore courteously than was her wont.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Good evening, master. Whence come ye so late? but speak low, for my\\n\\ngood man has sorely tired himself cleaving wood, and is taking a sleep,\\n\\nas you see, before supper!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'A good rest to him,\\' said Spare, perceiving he was not known. \\'I come\\n\\nfrom the court for a day\\'s hunting, and have lost my way in the forest.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Sit down and have a share of our supper,\\' said Fairfeather, \\'I will\\n\\nput some more eggs in the ashes; and tell me the news of court--I used\\n\\nto think of it long ago when I was young and foolish.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Did you never go there?\\' said the cobbler. \\'So fair a dame as you\\n\\nwould make the ladies marvel.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'You are pleased to flatter,\\' said Fairfeather; \\'but my husband has a\\n\\nbrother there, and we left our moorland village to try our fortune also.\\n\\nAn old woman enticed us with fair words and strong drink at the entrance\\n\\nof this forest, where we fell asleep and dreamt of great things; but\\n\\nwhen we woke, everything had been robbed from us--my looking-glass, my\\n\\nscarlet cloak, my husband\\'s Sunday coat; and, in place of all, the\\n\\nrobbers left him that old leathern doublet, which he has worn ever\\n\\nsince, and never was so merry in all his life, though we live in this\\n\\npoor hut.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'It is a shabby doublet, that,\\' said Spare, taking up the garment, and\\n\\nseeing that it was his own, for the merry leaves were still sewed in its\\n\\nlining. \\'It would be good for hunting in, however--your husband would be\\n\\nglad to part with it, I dare say, in exchange for this handsome cloak;\\'\\n\\nand he pulled off the green mantle and buttoned on the doublet, much to\\n\\nFairfeather\\'s delight, who ran and shook Scrub, crying--\"\\'Husband!\\n\\nhusband! rise and see what a good bargain I have made.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub gave one closing snore, and muttered something about the root\\n\\nbeing hard; but he rubbed his eyes, gazed up at his brother, and said--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Spare, is that really you? How did you like the court, and have you\\n\\nmade your fortune?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'That I have, brother,\\' said Spare, \\'in getting back my own good\\n\\nleathern doublet. Come, let us eat eggs, and rest ourselves here this\\n\\nnight. In the morning we will return to our own old hut, at the end of\\n\\nthe moorland village where the Christmas Cuckoo will come and bring us\\n\\nleaves.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Scrub and Fairfeather agreed. So in the morning they all returned, and\\n\\nfound the old hut little the worse for wear and weather. The neighbors\\n\\ncame about them to ask the news of court, and see if they had made their\\n\\nfortune. Everybody was astonished to find the three poorer than ever,\\n\\nbut somehow they liked to go back to the hut. Spare brought out the\\n\\nlasts and awls he had hidden in a corner; Scrub and he began their old\\n\\ntrade, and the whole north country found out that there never were such\\n\\ncobblers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They mended the shoes of lords and ladies as well as the common people;\\n\\neverybody was satisfied. Their custom increased from day to day, and all\\n\\nthat were disappointed, discontented, or unlucky, came to the hut as in\\n\\nold times, before Spare went to court.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The rich brought them presents, the poor did them service. The hut\\n\\nitself changed, no one knew how. Flowering honeysuckle grew over its\\n\\nroof; red and white roses grew thick about its door. Moreover, the\\n\\nChristmas Cuckoo always came on the first of April, bringing three\\n\\nleaves of the merry tree--for Scrub and Fairfeather would have no more\\n\\ngolden ones. So it was with them when I last heard the news of the north\\n\\ncountry.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: THE EMPEROR\\'S VISION]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 11: By permission from _Granny\\'s Wonderful Chair_, by Frances\\n\\nBrowne.

Dutton & Company.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE EMPEROR\\'S VISION[12]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIT happened at the time when Augustus was Emperor in Rome and Herod was\\n\\nKing in Jerusalem.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was then that a very great and holy night sank down over the earth.\\n\\nIt was the darkest night that any one had ever seen. One could have\\n\\nbelieved that the whole earth had fallen into a cellar-vault. It was\\n\\nimpossible to distinguish water from land, and one could not find one\\'s\\n\\nway on the most familiar road. And it couldn\\'t be otherwise, for not a\\n\\nray of light came from heaven. All the stars stayed at home in their own\\n\\nhouses, and the fair moon held her face averted.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe silence and the stillness were as profound as the darkness. The\\n\\nrivers stood still in their courses, the wind did not stir, and even the\\n\\naspen leaves had ceased to quiver. Had any one walked along the\\n\\nsea-shore, he would have found that the waves no longer dashed upon the\\n\\nsands; and had one wandered in the desert, the sand would not have\\n\\ncrunched under one\\'s feet. Everything was as motionless as if turned to\\n\\nstone, so as not to disturb the holy night. The grass was afraid to\\n\\ngrow, the dew could not fall, and the flowers dared not exhale their\\n\\nperfume.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn this night the wild beasts did not seek their prey, the serpents did\\n\\nnot sting, and the dogs did not bark. And what was even more glorious,\\n\\ninanimate things would have been unwilling to disturb the night\\'s\\n\\nsanctity, by lending themselves to an evil deed. No false key could have\\n\\npicked a lock, and no knife could possibly have drawn a drop of blood.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Rome, during this very night, a small company of people came from the\\n\\nEmperor\\'s palace at the Palatine and took the path across the Forum\\n\\nwhich led to the Capitol. During the day just ended the Senators had\\n\\nasked the Emperor if he had any objections to their erecting a temple to\\n\\nhim on Rome\\'s sacred hill. But Augustus had not immediately given his\\n\\nconsent. He did not know if it would be agreeable to the gods that he\\n\\nshould own a temple next to theirs, and he had replied that first he\\n\\nwished to ascertain their will in the matter by offering a nocturnal\\n\\nsacrifice to his genius. It was he who, accompanied by a few trusted\\n\\nfriends, was on his way to perform this sacrifice.\\n\\n\\n\\nAugustus let them carry him in his litter, for he was old, and it was an\\n\\neffort for him to climb the long stairs leading to the Capitol. He\\n\\nhimself held the cage with the doves for the sacrifice. No priests or\\n\\nsoldiers or senators accompanied him, only his nearest friends.\\n\\nTorch-bearers walked in front of him in order to light the way in the\\n\\nnight darkness and behind him followed the slaves, who carried the\\n\\ntripod, the knives, the charcoal, the sacred fire, and all the other\\n\\nthings needed for the sacrifice.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the way the Emperor chatted gayly with his faithful followers, and\\n\\ntherefore none of them noticed the infinite silence and stillness of the\\n\\nnight. Only when they had reached the highest point of the Capitol Hill\\n\\nand the vacant spot upon which they contemplated erecting the temple,\\n\\ndid it dawn upon them that something unusual was taking place.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt could not be a night like all others, for up on the very edge of the\\n\\ncliff they saw the most remarkable being! At first they thought it was\\n\\nan old, distorted olive-trunk; later they imagined that an ancient stone\\n\\nfigure from the temple of Jupiter had wandered out on the cliff. Finally\\n\\nit was apparent to them that it could be only the old sibyl.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnything so aged, so weather-beaten, and so giantlike in stature they\\n\\nhad never seen. This old woman was awe-inspiring! If the Emperor had not\\n\\nbeen present, they would all have fled to their homes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is she,\" they whispered to each other, \"who has lived as many years\\n\\nas there are sand-grains on her native shores. Why has she come out from\\n\\nher cave just to-night? What does she foretell for the Emperor and the\\n\\nEmpire--she, who writes her prophecies on the leaves of the trees and\\n\\nknows that the wind will carry the words of the oracle to the person for\\n\\nwhom they are intended?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThey were so terrified that they would have dropped on their knees with\\n\\ntheir foreheads pressed against the earth, had the sibyl stirred. But\\n\\nshe sat as still as though she were lifeless. Crouching upon the\\n\\noutermost edge of the cliff, and shading her eyes with her hand, she\\n\\npeered out into the night. She sat there as if she had gone up on the\\n\\nhill that she might see more clearly something that was happening far\\n\\naway. _She_ could see things on a night like this!\\n\\n\\n\\nAt that moment the Emperor and all his retinue, marked how profound the\\n\\ndarkness was. None of them could see a hand\\'s breadth in front of him.\\n\\nAnd what stillness! What silence! Not even the Tiber\\'s hollow murmur\\n\\ncould they hear. The air seemed to suffocate them, cold sweat broke out\\n\\non their foreheads, and their hands were numb and powerless. They feared\\n\\nthat some dreadful disaster was impending.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut no one cared to show that he was afraid, and every one told the\\n\\nEmperor that this was a good omen. All Nature held its breath to greet a\\n\\nnew god.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey counseled Augustus to hurry with the sacrifice, and said that the\\n\\nold sibyl had evidently come out of her cave to greet his genius.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the truth was that the old sibyl was so absorbed in a vision that\\n\\nshe did not even know that Augustus had come up to the Capitol. She was\\n\\ntransported in spirit to a far-distant land, where she imagined that she\\n\\nwas wandering over a great plain. In the darkness she stubbed her foot\\n\\ncontinually against something, which she believed to be grass-tufts. She\\n\\nstooped down and felt with her hand. No, it was not grass, but sheep.\\n\\nShe was walking between great sleeping flocks of sheep.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen she noticed the shepherds\\' fire. It burned in the middle of the\\n\\nfield, and she groped her way to it. The shepherds lay asleep by the\\n\\nfire, and beside them were the long, spiked staves with which they\\n\\ndefended their flocks from wild beasts. But the little animals with the\\n\\nglittering eyes and the bushy tails that stole up to the fire, were they\\n\\nnot jackals? And yet the shepherds did not fling their staves at them,\\n\\nthe dogs continued to sleep, the sheep did not flee, and the wild\\n\\nanimals lay down to rest beside the human beings.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis the sibyl saw, but she knew nothing of what was being enacted on\\n\\nthe hill back of her. She did not know that there they were raising an\\n\\naltar, lighting charcoal and strewing incense, and that the Emperor took\\n\\none of the doves from the cage to sacrifice it. But his hands were so\\n\\nbenumbed that he could not hold the bird. With one stroke of the wing,\\n\\nit freed itself and disappeared in the night darkness.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen this happened, the courtiers glanced suspiciously at the old sibyl.\\n\\nThey believed that it was she who caused the misfortune.\\n\\n\\n\\nCould they know that all the while the sibyl thought herself standing\\n\\nbeside the shepherds\\' fire, and that she listened to a faint sound which\\n\\ncame trembling through the dead-still night? She heard it long before\\n\\nshe marked that it did not come from earth, but from the sky. At last\\n\\nshe raised her head; then she saw light, shimmering forms glide forward\\n\\nin the darkness. They were little flocks of angels, who, singing\\n\\njoyously, and apparently searching, flew back and forth above the wide\\n\\nplain.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile the sibyl was listening to the angel-song, the Emperor was making\\n\\npreparations for a new sacrifice. He washed his hands, cleansed the\\n\\naltar, and took up the other dove. And, although he exerted his full\\n\\nstrength to hold it fast, the dove\\'s slippery body slid from his hand,\\n\\nand the bird swung itself up into the impenetrable night.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Emperor was appalled! He fell upon his knees and prayed to his\\n\\ngenius. He implored him for strength to avert the disasters which this\\n\\nnight seemed to foreshadow.\\n\\n\\n\\nNor did the sibyl hear any of this either. She was listening with her\\n\\nwhole soul to the angel-song, which grew louder and louder. At last it\\n\\nbecame so powerful that it wakened the shepherds. They raised themselves\\n\\non their elbows and saw shining hosts of silver-white angels move in\\n\\nthe darkness in long swaying lines, like migratory birds. Some held\\n\\nlutes and cymbals in their hands; others held zithers and harps, and\\n\\ntheir song rang out as merry as child-laughter, and as carefree as the\\n\\nlark\\'s thrill. When the shepherds heard this, they rose up to go to the\\n\\nmountain city, where they lived, to tell of the miracle.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey groped their way forward on a narrow, winding path, and the sibyl\\n\\nfollowed them. Suddenly it grew light up there on the mountain: a big,\\n\\nclear star kindled right over it, and the city on the mountain summit\\n\\nglittered like silver in the starlight. All the fluttering angel throngs\\n\\nhastened thither, shouting for joy, and the shepherds hurried so that\\n\\nthey almost ran. When they reached the city, they found that the angels\\n\\nhad assembled over a low stable near the city gate. It was a wretched\\n\\nstructure, with a roof of straw and the naked cliff for a back wall.\\n\\nOver it hung the Star, and hither flocked more and more angels. Some\\n\\nseated themselves on the straw roof or alighted upon the steep\\n\\nmountain-wall back of the house; others, again, held themselves in the\\n\\nair on outspread wings, and hovered over it. High, high up, the air was\\n\\nilluminated by the shining wings.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe instant the Star kindled over the mountain city, all Nature awoke,\\n\\nand the men who stood upon Capitol Hill could not help seeing it. They\\n\\nfelt fresh, but caressing winds which traveled through space; delicious\\n\\nperfumes streamed up about them; trees swayed; the Tiber began to\\n\\nmurmur; the stars twinkled, and suddenly the moon stood out in the sky\\n\\nand lit up the world. And out of the clouds the two doves came circling\\n\\ndown and lighted upon the Emperor\\'s shoulders.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen this miracle happened, Augustus rose, proud and happy, but his\\n\\nfriends and his slaves fell on their knees.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hail, Csar!\" they cried. \"Thy genius hath answered thee. Thou art the\\n\\ngod who shall be worshiped on Capitol Hill!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd this cry of homage, which the men in their transport gave as a\\n\\ntribute to the emperor, was so loud that the old sibyl heard it. It\\n\\nwaked her from her visions. She rose from her place on the edge of the\\n\\ncliff, and came down among the people. It was as if a dark cloud had\\n\\narisen from the abyss and rushed down the mountain height. She was\\n\\nterrifying in her extreme age! Coarse hair hung in matted tangles around\\n\\nher head, her joints were enlarged, and the dark skin, hard as the bark\\n\\nof a tree, covered her body with furrow upon furrow.\\n\\n\\n\\nPotent and awe-inspiring, she advanced toward the Emperor. With one hand\\n\\nshe clutched his wrist, with the other she pointed toward the distant\\n\\nEast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Look!\" she commanded, and the Emperor raised his eyes and saw. The\\n\\nvaulted heavens opened before his eyes, and his glance traveled to the\\n\\ndistant Orient. He saw a lowly stable behind a steep rock wall, and in\\n\\nthe open doorway a few shepherds kneeling. Within the stable he saw a\\n\\nyoung mother on her knees before a little child, who lay upon a bundle\\n\\nof straw on the floor.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the sibyl\\'s big, knotty fingers pointed toward the poor babe. \"Hail,\\n\\nCsar!\" cried the sibyl, in a burst of scornful laughter. \"There is the\\n\\ngod who shall be worshiped on Capitol Hill!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen Augustus shrank back from her, as from a maniac. But upon the sibyl\\n\\nfell the mighty spirit of prophecy. Her dim eyes began to burn, her\\n\\nhands were stretched toward heaven, her voice was so changed that it\\n\\nseemed not to be her own, but rang out with such resonance and power\\n\\nthat it could have been heard over the whole world. And she uttered\\n\\nwords which she appeared to be reading among the stars.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Upon Capitol Hill shall the Redeemer of the world be\\n\\nworshiped--_Christ_--but not frail mortals.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen she had said this, she strode past the terror-stricken men, walked\\n\\nslowly down the mountain, and disappeared.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, on the following day, Augustus strictly forbade the people to raise\\n\\nany temple to him on Capitol Hill. In place of it he built a sanctuary\\n\\nto the new-born GodChild, and called it HEAVEN\\'S ALTAR--_Ara Coeli_.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: THE VOYAGE OF THE WEE RED CAP]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 12: By permission from _Christ Legends,_ by Selma Lagerlof.\\n\\nCopyright by Henry Holt & Company.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE VOYAGE OF THE WEE RED CAP[13]\\n\\n\\n\\nIT was the Eve of St. Stephen, and Teig sat alone by his fire with\\n\\nnaught in his cupboard but a pinch of tea and a bare mixing of meal, and\\n\\na heart inside of him as soft and warm as the ice on the water bucket\\n\\noutside the door. The tuft was near burnt on the hearth--a handful of\\n\\ngolden cinders left, just; and Teig took to counting them greedily on\\n\\nhis fingers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s one, two, three, an\\' four an\\' five,\" he laughed. \"Faith, there\\n\\nbe more bits o\\' real gold hid undther the loose clay in the corner.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was the truth; and it was the scraping and scrooching for the last\\n\\npiece that had left Teig\\'s cupboard bare of a Christmas dinner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Gold is betther nor eatin\\' an\\' dthrinkin\\'. An\\' if ye have naught to\\n\\ngive, there\\'ll be naught asked of ye;\" and he laughed again.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was thinking of the neighbors, and the doles of food and piggins of\\n\\nmilk that would pass over their thresholds that night to the vagabonds\\n\\nand paupers who were sure to come begging. And on the heels of that\\n\\nthought followed another: who would be giving old Barney his dinner?\\n\\nBarney lived a stone\\'s throw from Teig, alone, in a wee tumbled-in\\n\\ncabin; and for a score of years past Teig had stood on the doorstep\\n\\nevery Christmas Eve, and, making a hollow of his two hands, had called\\n\\nacross the road:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hey, there, Barney, will ye come over for a sup?\" And Barney had\\n\\nreached for his crutches--there being but one leg to him--and had come.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Faith,\" said Teig, trying another laugh, \"Barney can fast for the once;\\n\\n\\'twill be all the same in a month\\'s time.\" And he fell to thinking of\\n\\nthe gold again.\\n\\n\\n\\nA knock came at the door. Teig pulled himself down in his chair where\\n\\nthe shadow would cover him, and held his tongue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Teig, Teig!\" It was the widow O\\'Donnelly\\'s voice. \"If ye are there,\\n\\nopen your door. I have not got the pay for the spriggin\\' this month, an\\'\\n\\nthe childher are needin\\' food.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Teig put the leash on his tongue, and never stirred till he heard\\n\\nthe tramp of her feet going on to the next cabin. Then he saw to it that\\n\\nthe door was tight-barred. Another knock came, and it was a stranger\\'s\\n\\nvoice this time:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The other cabins are filled; not one but has its hearth crowded; will\\n\\nye take us in--the two of us? The wind bites mortal sharp, not a morsel\\n\\no\\' food have we tasted this day. Masther, will ye take us in?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Teig sat on, a-holding his tongue; and the tramp of the strangers\\'\\n\\nfeet passed down the road. Others took their place--small feet, running.\\n\\nIt was the miller\\'s wee Cassie, and she called out as she ran by:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Old Barney\\'s watchin\\' for ye. Ye\\'ll not be forget-tin\\' him, will ye,\\n\\nTeig?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then the child broke into a song, sweet and clear, as she passed\\n\\ndown the road:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Listen all ye, \\'tis the Feast o\\' St. Stephen,\\n\\n    Mind that ye keep it, this holy even.\\n\\n    Open your door an\\' greet ye the stranger--\\n\\n    For ye mind that the wee Lord had naught but a manger.\\n\\n                                      Mhuire as traugh!\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Feed ye the hungry an\\' rest ye the weary,\\n\\n    This ye must do for the sake of Our Mary.\\n\\n    \\'Tis well that ye mind--ye who sit by the fire--\\n\\n    That the Lord he was born in a dark and cold byre.\\n\\n                                  Mhuire as traugh!\\n\\n\\n\\nTeig put his fingers deep in his ears. \"A million murdthering curses on\\n\\nthem that won\\'t let me be! Can\\'t a man try to keep what is his without\\n\\nbein\\' pesthered by them that has only idled an\\' wasted their days?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then a strange thing happened: hundreds and hundreds of wee lights\\n\\nbegan dancing outside the window, making the room bright; the hands of\\n\\nthe clock began chasing each other round the dial, and the bolt of the\\n\\ndoor drew itself out. Slowly, without a creak or a cringe, the door\\n\\nopened, and in there trooped a crowd of the Good People. Their wee green\\n\\ncloaks were folded close about them, and each carried a rush candle.\\n\\n\\n\\nTeig was filled with a great wonderment, entirely, when he saw the\\n\\nfairies, but when they saw him they laughed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We are takin\\' the loan o\\' your cabin this night, Teig,\" said they. \"Ye\\n\\nare the only man hereabout with an empty hearth, an\\' we\\'re needin\\' one.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWithout saying more, they bustled about the room making ready. They\\n\\nlengthened out the table and spread and set it; more of the Good People\\n\\ntrooped in, bringing stools and food and drink. The pipers came last,\\n\\nand they sat themselves around the chimney-piece a-blowing their\\n\\nchanters and trying the drones. The feasting began and the pipers played\\n\\nand never had Teig seen such a sight in his life. Suddenly a wee man\\n\\nsang out:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Clip, clap, clip, clap, I wish I had my wee red cap!\" And out of the\\n\\nair there tumbled the neatest cap Teig ever laid his two eyes on. The\\n\\nwee man clapped it on his head, crying:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wish I was in Spain!\" and--whist--up the chimney he went, and away\\n\\nout of sight.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt happened just as I am telling it. Another wee man called for his cap,\\n\\nand away he went after the first. And then another and another until the\\n\\nroom was empty and Teig sat alone again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"By my soul,\" said Teig, \"I\\'d like to thravel that way myself! It\\'s a\\n\\ngrand savin\\' of tickets an\\' baggage; an\\' ye get to a place before ye\\'ve\\n\\nhad time to change your mind. Faith there is no harm done if I thry it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo he sang the fairies\\' rime and out of the air dropped a wee cap for\\n\\nhim. For a moment the wonder had him, but the next he was clapping the\\n\\ncap on his head and crying:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Spain!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen--whist--up the chimney he went after the fairies, and before he had\\n\\ntime to let out his breath he was standing in the middle of Spain, and\\n\\nstrangeness all about him.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was in a great city. The doorways of the houses were hung with\\n\\nflowers and the air was warm and sweet with the smell of them. Torches\\n\\nburned along the streets, sweetmeat-sellers went about crying their\\n\\nwares, and on the steps of the cathedral crouched a crowd of beggars.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the meanin\\' o\\' that?\" asked Teig of one of the fairies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They are waiting for those that are hearing mass. When they come out,\\n\\nthey give half of what they have to those that have nothing, so on this\\n\\nnight of all the year there shall be no hunger and no cold.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then far down the street came the sound of a child\\'s voice, singing:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Listen all ye, \\'tis the Feast o\\' St. Stephen,\\n\\n    Mind that ye keep it, this holy even.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Curse it!\" said Teig; \"can a song fly afther ye?\" And then he heard the\\n\\nfairies cry \"Holland!\" and he cried \"Holland!\" too.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn one leap he was over France, and another over Belgium; and with the\\n\\nthird he was standing by long ditches of water frozen fast, and over\\n\\nthem glided hundreds upon hundreds of lads and maids. Outside each door\\n\\nstood a wee wooden shoe empty. Teig saw scores of them as he looked down\\n\\nthe ditch of a street.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What is the meanin\\' o\\' those shoes?\" he asked the fairies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ye poor lad!\" answered the wee man next to him; \"are ye not knowing\\n\\nanything? This is the Gift Night of the year, when every man gives to\\n\\nhis neighbor.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nA child came to the window of one of the houses, and in her hand was a\\n\\nlighted candle. She was singing as she put the light down close to the\\n\\nglass, and Teig caught the words:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Open your door an\\' greet ye the stranger--\\n\\n    For ye mind that the wee Lord had naught but a manger.\\n\\n                                    Mhuire as traugh!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Tis the de\\'il\\'s work!\" cried Teig, and he set the red cap more firmly\\n\\non his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m for another country.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI cannot be telling you half the adventures Teig had that night, nor\\n\\nhalf the sights that he saw. But he passed by fields that held sheaves\\n\\nof grain for the birds and doorsteps that held bowls of porridge for the\\n\\nwee creatures. He saw lighted trees, sparkling and heavy with gifts; and\\n\\nhe stood outside the churches and watched the crowds pass in, bearing\\n\\ngifts to the Holy Mother and Child.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last the fairies straightened their caps and cried, \"Now for the\\n\\ngreat hall in the King of England\\'s palace!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhist--and away they went, and Teig after them; and the first thing he\\n\\nknew he was in London, not an arm\\'s length from the King\\'s throne. It\\n\\nwas a grander sight than he had seen in any other country. The hall was\\n\\nfilled entirely with lords and ladies; and the great doors were open for\\n\\nthe poor and the homeless to come in and warm themselves by the King\\'s\\n\\nfire and feast from the King\\'s table. And many a hungry soul did the\\n\\nKing serve with his own hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nThose that had anything to give gave it in return. It might be a bit of\\n\\nmusic played on a harp or a pipe, or it might be a dance or a song; but\\n\\nmore often it was a wish, just, for good luck and safekeeping.\\n\\n\\n\\nTeig was so taken up with the watching that he never heard the fairies\\n\\nwhen they wished themselves off; moreover, he never saw the wee girl\\n\\nthat was fed, and went laughing away. But he heard a bit of her song as\\n\\nshe passed through the door:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Feed ye the hungry an\\' rest ye the weary,\\n\\n    This ye must do for the sake of Our Mary.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the anger had Teig. \"I\\'ll stop your pestherin\\' tongue, once an\\' for\\n\\nall time!\" and, catching the cap from his head, he threw it after her.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo sooner was the cap gone than every soul in the hall saw him. The next\\n\\nmoment they were about him, catching at his coat and crying:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where is he from, what does he here? Bring him before the King!\" And\\n\\nTeig was dragged along by a hundred hands to the throne where the King\\n\\nsat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He was stealing food,\" cried one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He was robbing the King\\'s jewels,\" cried another.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He looks evil,\" cried a third. \"Kill him!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd in a moment all the voices took it up and the hall rang with: \"Aye,\\n\\nkill him, kill him!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTeig\\'s legs took to trembling, and fear put the leash on his tongue; but\\n\\nafter a long silence he managed to whisper:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have done evil to no one--no one!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe,\" said the King; \"but have ye done good? Come, tell us, have ye\\n\\ngiven aught to any one this night? If ye have, we will pardon ye.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNot a word could Teig say--fear tightened the leash --for he was knowing\\n\\nfull well there was no good to him that night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then ye must die,\" said the King. \"Will ye try hanging or beheading?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hanging, please, your Majesty,\" said Teig.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe guards came rushing up and carried him off. But as he was crossing\\n\\nthe threshold of the hall a thought sprang at him and held him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Your Majesty,\" he called after him, \"will ye grant me a last request?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I will,\" said the King.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thank ye. There\\'s a wee red cap that I\\'m mortal fond of, and I lost it\\n\\na while ago; if I could be hung with it on, I would hang a deal more\\n\\ncomfortable.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe cap was found and brought to Teig.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Clip, clap, clip, clap, for my wee red cap, I wish I was home,\" he\\n\\nsang.\\n\\n\\n\\nUp and over the heads of the dumfounded guard he flew, and--whist--and\\n\\naway out of sight. When he opened his eyes again, he was sitting close\\n\\nby his own hearth, with the fire burnt low. The hands of the clock were\\n\\nstill, the bolt was fixed firm in the door. The fairies\\' lights were\\n\\ngone, and the only bright thing was the candle burning in old Barney\\'s\\n\\ncabin across the road.\\n\\n\\n\\nA running of feet sounded outside, and then the snatch of a song:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"\\'Tis well that ye mind--ye who sit by the fire--\\n\\n    That the Lord he was born in a dark and cold byre.\\n\\n                                  Mhuire as traugh!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wait ye, whoever ye are!\" and Teig was away to the corner, digging fast\\n\\nat the loose clay, as a terrier digs at a bone. He filled his hands full\\n\\nof the shining gold, then hurried to the door, unbarring it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe miller\\'s wee Cassie stood there, peering at him out of the darkness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Take those to the widow O\\'Donnelly, do ye hear? And take the rest to\\n\\nthe store. Ye tell Jamie to bring up all that he has that is eatable an\\'\\n\\ndhrinkable; and to the neighbors ye say, \\'Teig\\'s keepin\\' the feast this\\n\\nnight.\\' Hurry now!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTeig stopped a moment on the threshold until the tramp of her feet had\\n\\ndied away; then he made a hollow of his two hands and called across the\\n\\nroad:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hey there, Barney, will ye come over for a sup?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 13: By permission from _This Way to Christmas,_ by Ruth Sawyer\\n\\nDurand.

Among them all her feet were the lightest and\\n\\nher laugh the merriest, and in the telling of tales not one of them\\n\\ncould touch her. So if ever any among them were plotting mischief in\\n\\ntheir hearts, they would say to her:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Echo, thou weaver of words, go thou and sit beside Hera in her bower,\\n\\nand beguile her with a tale that she come not forth and find us. See\\n\\nthou make it a long one, Echo, and we will give thee a garland to twine\\n\\nin thy hair.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd Echo would laugh a gay laugh, which rang through the grove.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What will you do when she tires of my tales?\" she asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"When that time comes we shall see,\" said they.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo with another laugh she would trip away and cast herself on the grass\\n\\nat Hera\\'s feet. When Hera looked upon Echo her stern brow would relax,\\n\\nand she would smile upon her and stroke her hair.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What hast thou come for now, thou sprite?\" she would ask.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I had a great longing to talk with thee, great Hera,\" she would answer,\\n\\n\"and I have a tale--a wondrous new tale--to tell thee.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thy tales are as many as the risings of the sun, Echo, and each one of\\n\\nthem as long as an old man\\'s beard.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The day is yet young, mother,\" she would say, \"and the tales I have\\n\\ntold thee before are as mud which is trampled underfoot by the side of\\n\\nthe one I shall tell thee now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Go to, then,\" said Hera, \"and if it pleases me I will listen to the\\n\\nend.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Echo would sit upon the grass at Hera\\'s feet, and with her eyes fixed\\n\\nupon her face she would tell her tale. She had the gift of words, and,\\n\\nmoreover, she had seen and heard many strange things which she alone\\n\\ncould tell of. These she would weave into romances, adding to them as\\n\\nbest pleased her, or taking from them at will; for the best of\\n\\ntale-tellers are those who can lie, but who mingle in with their lies\\n\\nsome grains of truth which they have picked from their own experience.\\n\\nAnd Hera would forget her watchfulness and her jealousies, and listen\\n\\nentranced, while the magic of Echo\\'s words made each scene live before\\n\\nher eyes. Meanwhile the nymphs would sport to their hearts\\' content and\\n\\nnever fear her anger.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut at last came the black day of reckoning when Hera found out the\\n\\nprank which Echo had played upon her so long, and the fire of her wrath\\n\\nflashed forth like lightning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The gift whereby thou hast deceived me shall be thine no more,\" she\\n\\ncried. \"Henceforward thou shalt be dumb till some one else has spoken,\\n\\nand then, even if thou wilt, thou shalt not hold thy tongue, but must\\n\\nneeds repeat once more the last words that have been spoken.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Alas! alas!\" cried the nymphs in chorus.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Alas! alas!\" cried Echo after them, and could say no more, though she\\n\\nlonged to speak and beg Hera to forgive her. So did it come to pass that\\n\\nshe lost her voice, and could only say that which others put in her\\n\\nmouth, whether she wished it or no.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, it chanced one day that the young Narcissus strayed away from his\\n\\ncompanions in the hunt, and when he tried to find them he only wandered\\n\\nfurther, and lost his way upon the lonely heights of Helicon. He was\\n\\nnow in the bloom of his youth, nearing manhood, and fair as a flower in\\n\\nspring, and all who saw him straightway loved him and longed for him.\\n\\nBut, though his face was smooth and soft as maiden\\'s, his heart was hard\\n\\nas steel; and while many loved him and sighed for him, they could kindle\\n\\nno answering flame in his breast, but he would spurn them, and treat\\n\\nthem with scorn, and go on his way, nothing caring. When he was born,\\n\\nthe blind seer Teiresias had prophesied concerning him:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So long as he sees not himself he shall live and be happy.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd his words came true, for Narcissus cared for neither man nor woman,\\n\\nbut only for his own pleasure; and because he was so fair that all who\\n\\nsaw him loved him for his beauty, he found it easy to get from them what\\n\\nhe would. But he himself knew naught of love, and therefore but little\\n\\nof grief; for love at the best brings joy and sorrow hand in hand, and\\n\\nif unreturned, it brings naught but pain.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, when the nymphs saw Narcissus wandering alone through the woods,\\n\\nthey, too, loved him for his beauty, and they followed him wherever he\\n\\nwent. But because he was a mortal they were shy of him, and would not\\n\\nshow themselves, but hid behind the trees and rocks so that he should\\n\\nnot see them; and amongst the others Echo followed him, too. At last,\\n\\nwhen he found he had really wandered astray, he began to shout for one\\n\\nof his companions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ho, there! where art thou?\" he cried.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where art thou?\" answered Echo.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he heard the voice, he stopped and listened, but he could hear\\n\\nnothing more. Then he called again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am here in the wood--Narcissus.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"In the wood--Narcissus,\" said she.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come hither,\" he cried.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come hither,\" she answered.\\n\\n\\n\\nWondering at the strange voice which answered him, he looked all about,\\n\\nbut could see no one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Art thou close at hand?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Close at hand,\" answered Echo.\\n\\n\\n\\nWondering the more at seeing no one, he went forward in the direction of\\n\\nthe voice. Echo, when she found he was coming towards her, fled further,\\n\\nso that when next he called, her voice sounded far away. But wherever\\n\\nshe was, he still followed after her, and she saw that he would not let\\n\\nher escape; for wherever she hid, if he called, she had to answer, and\\n\\nso show him her hiding-place. By now they had come to an open space in\\n\\nthe trees, where the green lawn sloped down to a clear pool in the\\n\\nhollow. Here by the margin of the water she stood, with her back to the\\n\\ntall, nodding bulrushes, and as Narcissus came out from the trees she\\n\\nwrung her hands, and the salt tears dropped from her eyes; for she loved\\n\\nhim, and longed to speak to him, and yet she could not say a word. When\\n\\nhe saw her he stopped.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Art thou she who calls me?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who calls me?\" she answered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have told thee, Narcissus,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Narcissus,\" she cried, and held out her arms to him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who art thou?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who art thou?\" said she.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Have I not told thee,\" he said impatiently, \"Narcissus?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Narcissus,\" she said again, and still held out her hands beseechingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tell me,\" he cried, \"who art thou and why dost thou call me?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why dost thou call me?\" said she.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this he grew angry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Maiden, whoever thou art, thou hast led me a pretty dance through the\\n\\nwoods, and now thou dost nought but mock me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thou dost nought but mock me,\" said she.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this he grew yet more angry, and began to abuse her, but every word\\n\\nof abuse that he spoke she hurled back at him again. At last, tired out\\n\\nwith his wanderings and with anger, he threw himself on the grass by the\\n\\npool, and would not look at her nor speak to her again. For a time she\\n\\nstood beside him weeping, and longing to speak to him and explain, but\\n\\nnever a word could she utter. So at last in her misery she left him, and\\n\\nwent and hid herself behind a rock close by. After a while, when his\\n\\nanger had cooled down somewhat, Narcissus remembered he was very\\n\\nthirsty, and noticing for the first time the clear pool beside him, he\\n\\nbent over the edge of the bank to drink. As he held out his hand to take\\n\\nthe water, he saw looking up towards him a face which was the fairest\\n\\nface he had ever looked on, and his heart, which never yet had known\\n\\nwhat love was, at last was set on fire by the face in the pool. With a\\n\\nsigh he held out both his arms toward it, and the figure also held out\\n\\ntwo arms to him, and Echo from the rock answered back his sigh. When he\\n\\nsaw the figure stretching out towards him and heard the sigh, he thought\\n\\nthat his love was returned, and he bent down closer to the water and\\n\\nwhispered, \"I love thee.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I love thee,\" answered Echo from the rock.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt these words he bent down further, and tried to clasp the figure in\\n\\nhis arms, but as he did so, it vanished away. The surface of the pool\\n\\nwas covered with ripples, and he found he was clasping empty water to\\n\\nhis breast. So he drew back and waited awhile, thinking he had been\\n\\nover-hasty. In time, the ripples died away and the face appeared again\\n\\nas clear as before, looking up at him longingly from the water. Once\\n\\nagain he bent towards it, and tried to clasp it, and once again it fled\\n\\nfrom his embrace. Time after time he tried, and always the same thing\\n\\nhappened, and at last he gave up in despair, and sat looking down into\\n\\nthe water, with the teardrops falling from his eyes; and the figure in\\n\\nthe pool wept, too, and looked up at him with a look of longing and\\n\\ndespair. The longer he looked, the more fiercely did the flame of love\\n\\nburn in his breast, till at length he could bear it no more, but\\n\\ndetermined to reach the desire of his heart or die. So for the last time\\n\\nhe leaned forward, and when he found that once again he was clasping the\\n\\nempty water, he threw himself from the bank into the pool, thinking that\\n\\nin the depths, at any rate, he would find his love. But he found naught\\n\\nbut death among the weeds and stones of the pool, and knew not that it\\n\\nwas his own face he loved reflected in the water below him. Thus were\\n\\nthe words of the prophet fulfilled, \"So long as he sees not himself he\\n\\nshall live and be happy.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nEcho, peeping out from the rock, saw all that had happened, and when\\n\\nNarcissus cast himself into the pool she rushed forward, all too late,\\n\\nto stop him. When she found she could not save him, she cast herself on\\n\\nthe grass by the pool and wept and wept, till her flesh and her bones\\n\\nwasted away with weeping, and naught but her voice remained and the\\n\\ncurse that was on her. So to this day she lives, a formless voice\\n\\nhaunting rocks and caves and vaulted halls. Herself no man has seen\\n\\nsince the day Narcissus saw her wringing her hands for love of him\\n\\nbeside the nodding bulrushes, and no man ever shall see again. But her\\n\\nvoice we all have heard repeating our words when we thought that no one\\n\\nwas by; and though now she will say whatever we bid her, if once the\\n\\ncurse were removed, the cry of her soul would be:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Narcissus, Narcissus, my love, come back--come back to me!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the side of the clear brown pool, on the grass that Echo had watered\\n\\nwith her tears, there sprang up a sweet-scented flower, with a pure\\n\\nwhite face and a crown of gold. And to this day in many a land men call\\n\\nthat flower \"Narcissus,\" after the lad who, for love of his own fair\\n\\nface, was drowned in the waters of Helicon.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: HOW THE ASS BECAME A MAN AGAIN]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 14: From _Children of the Dawn,_ by Elsie Finnimore Buckley.\\n\\nStokes, London.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW THE ASS BECAME A MAN AGAIN[15]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nONCE upon a time there lived a young man who would do nothing from\\n\\nmorning till night but amuse himself. His parents were dead and had left\\n\\nhim plenty of money, but this was fast vanishing, and his friends shook\\n\\ntheir heads sadly, for when the money was gone they did not see where\\n\\nmore was to come from. It was not that Apuleius (for that was the name\\n\\nof the youth) was stupid. He might have been a good soldier, or a\\n\\nscholar, or a worker in gold, if so it had pleased him, but from a child\\n\\nhe had refused to do anything useful, and roamed about the city all day\\n\\nlong in search of adventures. The only kind of learning to which he paid\\n\\nany heed was magic, and when he was in the house he would spend hours\\n\\nporing over great books of spells.\\n\\n\\n\\nFond though he was of sorcery, he was too lazy to leave the town and its\\n\\npleasures--the chariot-racing, the theater, and the wrestling, and to\\n\\ntravel in search of the wizards who were renowned for their skill in the\\n\\nart. However, the time came when, very unwillingly, he was forced to\\n\\ntake a journey into Thessaly, to see to the proper working of some\\n\\nsilver mines in which he had a share, and Thessaly, as everybody knows,\\n\\nis the home of all magic. So when Apuleius arrived at the town of\\n\\nHypata, where dwelt the man Milo, overseer of his mines, he was prepared\\n\\nto believe that all he saw was enchanted.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, if Thessaly is the country of magic, it is also the country of\\n\\nrobbers, and Apuleius soon noticed that everybody he met was in fear of\\n\\nthem. Indeed, they made this fear the excuse for all sorts of mean and\\n\\nfoolish ways. For instance, Milo, who loved money and could not bear to\\n\\nspend a farthing, refused to have any seats in his house that could be\\n\\nremoved, and in consequence there was nothing to sit upon except two\\n\\nmarble chairs fixed to the wall. As there was only room in these for one\\n\\nperson, the wife of Milo had to retire to her own chamber when the young\\n\\nman entered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It was no use,\" explained Milo, \"in laying out money on moveable seats,\\n\\nwith robbers about. They would be sure to hear of it and to break into\\n\\nthe house.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nUnlike his guest, Milo was always occupied in adding to his wealth in\\n\\none form or another. Sometimes he sent down a train of mules to the\\n\\nsea, and bought merchandise which the ships had carried from Babylon or\\n\\nEgypt, to sell it again at a high price. Then he dealt in sheep and\\n\\ncattle, and when he thought he might do so with safety made false\\n\\nreturns of the silver that was dug up from the mines, and kept the\\n\\ndifference for himself. But most often he lent large sums at high\\n\\ninterest to the young men of the neighborhood, and so cunning was he\\n\\nthat, whoever else might be ruined, Milo managed to make large profits.\\n\\n\\n\\nApuleius knew very well that his steward was in his way as great a\\n\\nrobber as any in Thessaly, but, as usual, he found it too much trouble\\n\\nto look into the matter. So he laughed and jested with the miser, and\\n\\nnext morning went out to the public baths and then took a stroll through\\n\\nthe city. It was full of statues of the famous men to whom Hypata had\\n\\ngiven birth; but as Apuleius had made up his mind that nothing in\\n\\nThessaly _could_ be what it seemed, he supposed that they were living\\n\\npeople who had fallen under enchantment, and that the oxen whom he met\\n\\ndriven through the streets had once been men and women.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne evening he was returning as usual from a walk when he saw from afar\\n\\nthree figures before Milo\\'s house, whom he at once guessed were trying\\n\\nto force an entrance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here is an adventure at last,\" thought he, and, keeping in the shadow,\\n\\nhe stole softly up behind them, and drawing his short sword he stabbed\\n\\neach one to the heart. Then, without waiting to see what more would\\n\\nbefall, he left them where they were and entered the house by a door at\\n\\nthe back.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said nothing of what had happened to Milo his host, but the next day,\\n\\nbefore he had left his bed, a summons was brought him by one of the\\n\\nslaves to appear before the court at noon on a charge of murder. As has\\n\\nbeen seen, Apuleius was a brave man and did not fear to face three times\\n\\nhis number, but his heart quailed at the thought of a public trial.\\n\\nStill, he was wise enough to know that there was no help for it, and at\\n\\nthe hour appointed he was in his place.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first witnesses against him were two women with black veils covering\\n\\nthem from head to foot. At the sound of the herald\\'s trumpet, one of the\\n\\ntwo stepped forward and accused him of compassing the death of her\\n\\nhusband. When she had ended her plaint the herald blew another blast,\\n\\nand another veiled woman came forward and charged him with her son\\'s\\n\\nmurder. Then the herald inquired if there was not yet a third victim,\\n\\nbut was answered that his wound was slight, and that he was able to roam\\n\\nthrough the city.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the witnesses had been called, the judge pronounced sentence.\\n\\nApuleius the murderer was condemned to death, but he must first of all\\n\\nbe tortured, so that he might reveal the names of the men who had\\n\\nabetted him. By order of the court, horrible instruments were brought\\n\\nforward which chilled the blood of Apuleius in his veins. But to his\\n\\nsurprise, when he looked round to see if none would be his friend, he\\n\\nnoticed that every one, from the judge to the herald, was shaking with\\n\\nlaughter. His amazement was increased when with a trembling voice one of\\n\\nthe women demanded that the bodies should be produced, so that the judge\\n\\nmight be induced to feel more pity and to order more tortures. The judge\\n\\nassented to this, and two bodies were carried into court shrouded in\\n\\nwrappings, and the order was given that Apuleius himself should remove\\n\\nthe wrappings.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe face of the young man grew white as he heard the words of the judge,\\n\\nfor even a hardened criminal cares but little to touch the corpse of a\\n\\nman whom he has murdered. But he dared not disobey, and walked slowly to\\n\\nthe place where the dead bodies lay. He shrank for a moment as he took\\n\\nthe cloth in his hands, but his guards were behind him, and calling up\\n\\nall his courage, he withdrew it. A shout of laughter pealed out behind\\n\\nhim, and to his amazement he saw that his victims of the previous night\\n\\nhad been three huge leather bottles and not men at all!\\n\\n\\n\\nAs soon as Apuleius found out the trick that had been played on him he\\n\\nwas no less amused than the rest, but in the midst of his mirth a sudden\\n\\nthought struck him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How was it you managed to make them alive?\" asked he, \"for alive they\\n\\nwere, and battering themselves against the door of the house.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, that is simple enough when one has a sorceress for a mistress,\"\\n\\nanswered a damsel, who was standing by. \"She burned the hairs of some\\n\\ngoats and wove spells over them, so that the animals to whom the hairs\\n\\nand skins had once belonged became endowed with life and tried to enter\\n\\ntheir former dwelling.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They may well say that Thessaly is the home of wonders,\" cried the\\n\\nyoung man. \"But do you think that your mistress would let me see her at\\n\\nwork? I would pay her well--and you also,\" he added.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It might be managed perhaps, without her knowledge,\" answered Fotis,\\n\\nfor such was the girl\\'s name; \"but you must hold yourself in readiness\\n\\nafter nightfall, for I cannot tell what evening she may choose to cast\\n\\noff her own shape.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nApuleius promised readily that he would not stir out after sunset, and\\n\\nthe damsel went her way.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat very evening, Hesperus had scarcely risen from his bed when Fotis\\n\\nknocked at the door of the house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come hither, and quickly,\" she said; and without stopping to question\\n\\nher Apuleius hastened by her side to the dwelling of the witch Pamphile.\\n\\nEntering softly, they crept along a dark passage, where they could peep\\n\\nthrough a crack in the wall and see Pamphile at work. She was in the act\\n\\nof rubbing her body with essences from a long row of bottles which stood\\n\\nin a cupboard in the wall, chanting to herself spells as she did so.\\n\\nSlowly, feathers began to sprout from her head to her feet. Her arms\\n\\nvanished, her nails became claws, her eyes grew round and her nose\\n\\nhooked, and a little brown owl flew out of the window.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, are you satisfied?\" asked Fotis, but Apuleius shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not yet,\" he answered. \"I want to know how she transforms herself into\\n\\na woman again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That is quite easy, you may be sure,\" replied Fotis. \"My mistress\\n\\nnever runs any risks. A cup of water from a spring, with some laurel\\n\\nleaves and anise floating in it, is all that she needs. I have seen her\\n\\ndo it a thousand times.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Turn me into a nightingale, then, and I will give you five hundred\\n\\nsesterces,\" cried Apuleius eagerly; and Fotis, tempted by the thought of\\n\\nso much money, agreed to do what he wished.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut either Fotis was not so skilful as she thought herself, or in her\\n\\nhurry she neglected to observe that the bird bottles were all on one\\n\\nshelf, and the beast bottles on another, for when she had rubbed the\\n\\nointment over the young man\\'s chest something fearful happened. Instead\\n\\nof his arms disappearing, they stretched downwards; his back became\\n\\nbent, his face long and narrow, while a browny-gray fur covered his\\n\\nbody. Apuleius had been changed, not into a nightingale, but into an\\n\\nass!\\n\\n\\n\\nA loud scream broke from Fotis when she saw what she had done, and\\n\\nApuleius, glancing at a polished mirror from Corinth which hung on the\\n\\nwalls, beheld with horror the fate that had overtaken him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Quick, quick! fetch the water, and I will seek for the laurels and\\n\\nanise,\" he cried. \"I do not want to be an ass at all; my arms and back\\n\\nare aching already, and if I am not swiftly restored to my own shape I\\n\\nshall not be able to overthrow the champion in the wrestling match\\n\\nto-morrow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Fotis ran out to draw the water from the spring, while Apuleius\\n\\nopened some boxes with his teeth, and soon found the anise and laurels.\\n\\nBut alas! Fotis had deceived herself. The charm which was meant for a\\n\\nbird would not work with a beast, and, what was worse, when Apuleius\\n\\ntried to speak to her and beg her to try something else, he found he\\n\\ncould only bray!\\n\\n\\n\\nIn despair the girl took down the book of spells, and began to turn over\\n\\nthe pages; while the ass, who was still a man in all but his outward\\n\\nform, glanced eagerly down them also. At length he gave a loud bray of\\n\\nsatisfaction, and rubbed his nose on a part of the long scroll.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Of course, I remember now,\" cried Fotis with delight. \"What a comfort\\n\\nthat nothing more is needed to restore you to your proper shape than a\\n\\nhandful of rose leaves!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe mind of Apuleius was now quite easy, but his spirits fell again when\\n\\nFotis reminded him that he could no longer expect to be received by his\\n\\nfriends, but must lie in the stable of Milo, with his own horse, and be\\n\\ntended, if he was tended at all, by his own servant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"However, it will not be for long,\" she added consolingly. \"In the\\n\\ncorner of the stable is a little shrine to the goddess of horses, and\\n\\nevery day fresh roses are placed before it. Before the sun sets\\n\\nto-morrow you will be yourself again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSlowly and shyly Apuleius slunk along lonely paths till he came to the\\n\\nstable of Milo. The door was open, but, as he entered, his horse, who\\n\\nwas fastened with a sliding cord, kicked wildly at him, and caught him\\n\\nright on the shoulder. But before the horse could deal another blow\\n\\nApuleius had sprung hastily on one side, and had hidden himself in a\\n\\ndark corner, where he slept soundly.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe moon was shining brightly when he awoke, and looking round, he saw,\\n\\nas Fotis had told him, the shrine of Hippone, with a branch of\\n\\nsweet-smelling pink roses lying before it. It was rather high up, he\\n\\nthought, but, when he reared himself on his hind legs, he would surely\\n\\nbe tall enough to reach it. So up he got, and trod softly over the\\n\\nstraw, till he drew near the shrine, when with a violent effort he threw\\n\\nup his forelegs into the air. Yes! it was all right, his nose was quite\\n\\nnear the roses; but just as he opened his mouth his balance gave way,\\n\\nand his front feet came heavily on the floor.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe noise brought the man, who was sleeping in another part of the\\n\\nstable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I see what you are at, you ugly beast,\" cried he; \"would you eat\\n\\nroses that I put there for the goddess? I don\\'t know who may be your\\n\\nmaster, or how you got here, but I will take care that you do no more\\n\\nmischief.\" So saying, he struck the ass several times with his fists,\\n\\nand then, putting a rope round his neck, tied him up in another part of\\n\\nthe stable.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow it happened that an hour or two later some of the most desperate\\n\\nrobbers in all Thessaly broke into the house of Milo, and, unheard by\\n\\nany one, took all the bags of money that the miser had concealed under\\n\\nsome loose stones in his cellar. It was clear that they could not carry\\n\\naway such heavy plunder without risk of the crime being discovered, but\\n\\nthey managed to get it quietly as far as the stable, where they gave the\\n\\nhorse some apples to put it in a good temper, while they thrust a turnip\\n\\ninto the mouth of Apuleius, who did not like it at all. Then they led\\n\\nout both the animals, and placed the sacks of money on their backs,\\n\\nafter which they all set out for the robbers\\' cave in the side of the\\n\\nmountain. As this, however, was some distance off, it took them many\\n\\nhours to reach it, and on the way they passed through a large deserted\\n\\ngarden, where rose bushes of all sorts grew like weeds. The pulse of\\n\\nApuleius bounded at the sight, and he had already stretched out his nose\\n\\ntowards them, when he suddenly remembered that if he should turn into a\\n\\nman in his present company he would probably be murdered by the robbers.\\n\\nWith a great effort, he left the roses alone, and tramped steadily on\\n\\nhis way.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt were long indeed to tell the adventures of Apuleius and the number of\\n\\nmasters whom he served. After some time he was captured by a soldier,\\n\\nand by him sold to two brothers, one a cook and the other a maker of\\n\\npastry, who were attached to the service of a rich man who lived in the\\n\\ncountry. This man did not allow any of his slaves to dwell in his house,\\n\\nexcept those who attended on him personally, and these two brothers\\n\\nlived in a tent on the other side of the garden, and the ass was given\\n\\nto them to send to and fro with savory dishes in his panniers.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe cook and his brother were both careful men, and always had a great\\n\\nstore of pastry and sweet things on their shelves, so that none might be\\n\\nlacking if their lord should command them. When they had done their work\\n\\nthey placed water and food for their donkey in a little shed which\\n\\nopened on to the tent, then, fastening the door so that no one could\\n\\nenter, they went out to enjoy the evening air.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn their return, it struck them that the tent looked unusually bare, and\\n\\nat length they perceived that this was because every morsel of pastry\\n\\nand sweets on the shelves had disappeared, and nothing was left of them,\\n\\nnot so much as a crumb. There was no room for a thief to hide, so the\\n\\ntwo brothers supposed that, impossible it seemed, he must not only have\\n\\ngot _in_ but _out_ by the door, and, as their master might send for a\\n\\ntray of cakes at any moment, there was no help for it but to make a\\n\\nfresh supply. And so they did, and it took them more than half the night\\n\\nto do it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next evening the same thing happened again; and the next, and the\\n\\nnext, and the next.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, by accident, the cook went into the shed where the ass lay, and\\n\\ndiscovered a heap of corn and hay that reached nearly to the roof.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, you rascal!\" he exclaimed, bursting out laughing as he spoke. \"So\\n\\nit is you who have cost us our sleep! Well, well, I dare say I should\\n\\nhave done the same myself, for cakes and sweets are certainly nicer than\\n\\ncorn and hay.\" And the donkey brayed in answer, and winked an eye at\\n\\nhim, and, more amused than before, the man went away to tell his\\n\\nbrother.\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course it was not long before the story reached the ears of their\\n\\nmaster, who instantly sent to buy the donkey, and bade one of his\\n\\nservants, who had a taste for such things, teach him fresh tricks. This\\n\\nthe man was ready enough to do, for the fame of this wonderful creature\\n\\nsoon spread far and wide, and the citizens of the town thronged the\\n\\ndoors of his stable. And while the servant reaped much gold by making\\n\\nthe ass display his accomplishments, the master gained many friends\\n\\namong the people, and was soon made chief ruler.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor five years Apuleius stayed in the house of Thyasus, and ate as many\\n\\nsweet cakes as he chose; and if he wanted more than were given him he\\n\\nwandered down to the tent of his old masters, and swept the shelves bare\\n\\nas of yore. At the end of the five years Thyasus proclaimed that a great\\n\\nfeast would be held in his garden, after which plays would be acted, and\\n\\nin one of them his donkey should appear.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, though Apuleius loved eating and drinking, he was not at all fond\\n\\nof doing tricks in public, and as the day drew near he grew more and\\n\\nmore resolved that he would take no part in the entertainment. So one\\n\\nwarm moonlight night he stole out of his stable, and galloped as fast as\\n\\nhe could for ten miles, when he reached the sea. He was hot and tired\\n\\nwith his long run, and the sea looked cool and pleasant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is years since I have had a bath,\" thought he, \"or wetted anything\\n\\nbut my feet. I will take one now; it will make me feel like a man\\n\\nagain\"; and into the water he went, and splashed about with\\n\\njoy, which would much have surprised any one who had seen him, for asses\\n\\ndo not in general care about washing.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he came back to dry land once more, he shook himself all over, and\\n\\nheld his head first on one side and then on the other, so that the water\\n\\nmight run out of his long ears. After that he felt quite comfortable,\\n\\nand lay down to sleep under a tree.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was awakened some hours later by the sound of voices singing a hymn,\\n\\nand, raising his head, he saw a vast crowd of people trooping down to\\n\\nthe shore to hold the festival of their goddess, and in their midst\\n\\nwalked the high priest crowned with a wreath of roses.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this sight hope was born afresh in the heart of Apuleius. It was long\\n\\nindeed since he had beheld any roses, for Thyasus fancied they made him\\n\\nill, and would not suffer any one to grow them in the city. So he drew\\n\\nnear to the priest as he passed by, and gazed at him so wistfully that,\\n\\nmoved by some sudden impulse, the pontiff lifted the wreath from his\\n\\nhead, and held it out to him, while the people drew to one side,\\n\\nfeeling that something was happening which they did not understand.\\n\\n\\n\\nScarcely had Apuleius swallowed one of the roses, when the ass\\'s skin\\n\\nfell from him, his back straightened itself, and his face once more\\n\\nbecame fair and rosy. Then he turned and joined in the hymn, and there\\n\\nwas not a man among them all with a sweeter voice or more thankful\\n\\nspirit than that of Apuleius.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: HOW ALEXANDER THE KING GOT THE WATER OF LIFE]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 15: Reprinted by permission from _The Red Book of Romance_.\\n\\nEdited by Andrew Lang.

For this service the little\\n\\n\"Aleko\" is to be helped with his lessons. By way of getting acquainted\\n\\nthe old man asks, \"Tell me, now, what do they call you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They call me Aleko.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"From where?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My mother lives in Megaloupolis, and I was born there and the little\\n\\nones, but my father was not from there.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nKyr Themistocli noticed the past tense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He is dead, your father?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, it is two years ago that he died.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And from where was he?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"From Siatista.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, a Macedonian! And what was his name?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Philippos Vasiliou.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So your name is Alexandros Vasiliou?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAleko nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Alexander of the King! Alexander the son of Philip! Your master has\\n\\ntaught you about him at school?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said Aleko, frowning.\\n\\n\\n\\n     The old man smiled. There is a story about him which you have not\\n\\n     heard perhaps. Do you know how _Alexander the King got the Water of\\n\\n     Life?_\"\\n\\n\\n\\n     Aleko shook his head: \"We have not reached such a part.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n     \"Well, I will tell you about it.  Listen:--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"WHEN Alexander the King had conquered all the Kingdoms of the world,\\n\\nand when all the universe trembled at his glance, he called before him\\n\\nthe most celebrated magicians of those days and said to them:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Ye who are wise, and who know all that is written in the Book of Fate,\\n\\ntell me what I must do to live for many years and to enjoy this world\\n\\nwhich I have made mine?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'O King!\\' said the magicians, \\'great is thy power! But what is written\\n\\nin the Book of Fate is written, and no one in Heaven or on Earth can\\n\\nefface it. There is one thing only, that can make thee enjoy thy kingdom\\n\\nand thy glory beyond the lives of men; that can make thee endure as long\\n\\nas the hills, but it is very hard to accomplish.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'I did not ask ye,\\' said the great King Alexander, \\'whether it be hard,\\n\\nI asked only what it was.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'O King, we are at thy feet to command! Know then that he alone who\\n\\ndrinks of the Water of Life need not fear death. But he who seeks this\\n\\nwater, must pass through two mountains which open and close constantly,\\n\\nand scarce a bird on the wing can fly between them and not be crushed to\\n\\ndeath. The bones lie in high piles, of the king\\'s sons who have lost\\n\\ntheir lives in this terrible trap. But if thou shouldst pass safely\\n\\nthrough the closing mountains, even then thou wilt find beyond them a\\n\\nsleepless dragon who guards the Water of Life. Him also must thou slay\\n\\nbefore thou canst take the priceless treasure.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then Alexander the King smiled, and ordered his slaves to bring forth\\n\\nhis horse Bucephalus, who had no wings yet flew like a bird. The king\\n\\nmounted on his back and the good horse neighed for joy. With one\\n\\ntriumphant bound he was through the closing mountains so swiftly that\\n\\nonly three hairs of his flowing tail were caught in between the giant\\n\\nrocks when they closed. Then Alexander the King slew the sleepless\\n\\ndragon, filled his vial with the Water of Life, and returned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But when he reached his palace, so weary was he that he fell into a\\n\\ndeep sleep and left the Water of Life unguarded. And it so happened that\\n\\nhis sister, not knowing the value of the water, threw it away. And some\\n\\nof the water fell on a wild onion plant, and that is why, to this day,\\n\\nwild onion plants never fade. Now when Alexander awoke, he stretched out\\n\\nhis hand to seize and drink the Water of Life and found naught; and in\\n\\nhis rage he would have killed the slaves who guarded his sleep, but his\\n\\nsister being of royal blood, could not hide the truth, and she told him\\n\\nthat, not knowing she had thrown the Water of Life away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then the king waxed terrible in his wrath, and he cast a curse upon his\\n\\nsister, and prayed that from the waist downward she might be turned into\\n\\na fish, and live always in the open sea far from all land and habitation\\n\\nof man. And the gods granted his prayer, so it happens that to this day\\n\\nthose who sail over the open sea in ships often see Alexander\\'s sister,\\n\\nhalf a woman and half a fish, tossing in the waves. Strange to say, she\\n\\ndoes not hate Alexander, and when a ship passes close to her she cries\\n\\nout: \\'Does Alexander live?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And should the captain, not knowing who it is that speaks, answer, \\'He\\n\\nis dead,\\' then the maid in her great grief tosses her white arms and her\\n\\nlong golden hair wildly about, and troubles the water, and sinks the\\n\\nship. But if, when the question comes up with the voice of the wind,\\n\\n\\'Does Alexander live?\\' the captain answers at once, \\'He lives and\\n\\nreigns,\\' then the maid\\'s heart is joyful and she sings sweet songs till\\n\\nthe ship is out of sight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And this is how sailors learn new love songs, and sing them when they\\n\\nreturn to land.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the old man ceased speaking Aleko waited a moment and then said\\n\\nslowly:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That is not true--but I like it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 16: By permission from _Under Greek Skies,_ by Julia\\n\\nDragoumis.

Every day he played at sticks, and he was almost always\\n\\nunlucky. Sometimes he would lose everything that he had, and would even\\n\\nlose things belonging to his father. His father had often scolded him\\n\\nabout gambling, and had told him that he ought to stop it. There were\\n\\ntwo things that he never staked; these two things were his shield and\\n\\nhis lance.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne day he played sticks for a long time, and when he got through he had\\n\\nlost everything that he had except these two things. When he went home\\n\\nat night to his father\\'s lodge he told his relations what he had done,\\n\\nand his father said to him:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My son, for a long time you have been doing this, and I have many times\\n\\nspoken to you about it. Now I have done. I cannot have you here any\\n\\nlonger. You cannot live here in my lodge or in this village. You must go\\n\\naway.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young man thought about it for a little while and then he said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I will go. It does not make much difference where I am.\" So he\\n\\ntook his shield and his spear and went out of the lodge and started to\\n\\ngo away from the village. When he got outside of the village and had\\n\\ngone some distance, he heard behind him a loud rushing sound like a\\n\\nstrong wind--the sound kept getting nearer and louder--and all at once\\n\\nit was above him, and then the sound stopped, and something spoke to him\\n\\nand said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I am here. I have come to find you. I have been sent, and am here\\n\\non purpose to get you and take you with me.\" The voice that spoke to him\\n\\nwas the Wind.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Wind took the young man up and carried him away towards the west.\\n\\nThey traveled many days, and passed over broad prairies and then across\\n\\nhigh mountains and then over high, wide plains and over other mountains\\n\\nuntil they came to the end of the world, where the sky bends down and\\n\\ntouches the ground. The last thing the young man saw was the gate\\n\\nthrough the edge of the sky. A great buffalo bull stands in this gateway\\n\\nand blocks it up. He had to move to one side to let the Wind and the\\n\\nyoung man pass through. Every year one hair drops from the hide of this\\n\\nbull. When all have fallen the end of the world will come.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter they had passed through this gate they went on, and it seemed as\\n\\nif they were passing over a big water. There was nothing to be seen\\n\\nexcept the sky and the water. At last they came to a land. Here were\\n\\nmany people--great crowds of them. The Wind told the young man:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"These are all waiters on the Father.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThey went on, and at last came to the Father\\'s lodge and went in. When\\n\\nthey had sat down the Father spoke to the young man and said to him:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My son, I have known you for a long time, and have watched you. I\\n\\nwanted to see you, and that is why I gave you bad luck at the sticks,\\n\\nand why I sent my Wind to bring you here. Your people are very hungry\\n\\nnow because they can find no buffalo, but I am going to give you\\n\\nsomething on which you can live, even when the buffalo fail.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he gave him three little sacks. The first contained squash seed;\\n\\nthe second beans, red and white; and the third corn, white, red, blue\\n\\nand yellow. The Father said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tie these sacks to your shield and do not lose them. When you get back\\n\\nto your people give each one some of the seeds and tell him to put them\\n\\nin the ground; then they will make more. These things are good to eat,\\n\\nbut the first year do not let the people eat them; let them put the\\n\\nyield away and the next year again put it in the ground. After that they\\n\\ncan eat a part of what grows, but they must always save some for seed.\\n\\nSo the people will always have something to eat with their buffalo meat,\\n\\nand something to depend on if the buffalo fail.\" The Father gave him\\n\\nalso a buffalo robe, and said to him:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"When you go back, the next day after you have got there, call all the\\n\\npeople together in your lodge, and give them what is in this robe, and\\n\\ntell them all these things. Now you can go back to your people.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Wind took the young man back. They traveled a long time, and at last\\n\\nthey came to the Pawnee village. The Wind put the young man down, and he\\n\\nwent into his father\\'s lodge and said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Father, I am here.\" But his father did not believe him, and said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is not you.\" He had been gone so long that they had thought him\\n\\ndead. Then he said to his mother:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mother, I am here.\" And his mother knew him and was glad that he had\\n\\nreturned.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this time the people had no buffalo. They had scouted far and near\\n\\nand could find none anywhere, and they were all very hungry. The little\\n\\nchildren cried with hunger. The next day after he got back, the young\\n\\nman sent out an old man to go through the camp and call all the people\\n\\nto come to his father\\'s lodge. When they were there, he opened his robe\\n\\nand spread it out, and it was covered with pieces of fat buffalo meat\\n\\npiled high. The young man gave to each person all he could carry, but\\n\\nwhile he was handing out the pieces, his father was trying to pull off\\n\\nthe robe the hind-quarters of the buffalo and hide them. He was afraid\\n\\nthat the young man might give away all the meat, and he wanted to save\\n\\nthis for their own lodge. But the young man said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Father, do not take this away. Do not touch anything. There is enough.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter he had given them the meat he showed them the sacks of seed and\\n\\ntold them what they were for, and explained to them that they must not\\n\\neat any the first year, but that they must always save some to plant,\\n\\nand the people listened. Then he said to them:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I hear that you have no buffalo. Come out to-morrow and I will show you\\n\\nwhere to go for buffalo.\" The People wondered where this could be, for\\n\\nthey had traveled far in all directions looking for buffalo. The next\\n\\nday they went out as he had told them, and the young man sent two boys\\n\\nto the top of a high hill close to camp, and told them to let him know\\n\\nwhat they saw from it. When the boys got to the top of the hill, they\\n\\nsaw down below them in the hollow a big band of buffalo.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the people learned that the buffalo were there, they all took their\\n\\narrows and ran out and chased the buffalo and made a big killing, so\\n\\nthat there was plenty in the camp and they made much dried meat. Four\\n\\ndays after this he again sent out the boys, and they found buffalo. Now\\n\\nthat they had plenty of meat they stayed in one place, and when spring\\n\\ncame the young man put the seed in the ground. When the people first saw\\n\\nthese strange plants growing they wondered at them, for they were new\\n\\nand different from anything that they had ever seen growing on the\\n\\nprairie. They liked the color of the young stalks, and the way they\\n\\ntasseled out, and the way the ears formed. They found that besides being\\n\\npretty to look at they were good to eat, for when the young man had\\n\\ngathered the crop he gave the people a little to taste, so that they\\n\\nmight know the words that he had spoken were true. The rest he kept for\\n\\nseed. Next season he gave all the people seed to plant, and after that\\n\\nthey always had these things.\\n\\n\\n\\nLater, this young man became one of the head men, and taught the people\\n\\nmany things. He told them that always when they killed buffalo they must\\n\\nbring the fattest and offer them to the Father. He taught them about the\\n\\nsacred bundles, and told them that they must put an ear of corn on the\\n\\nbundles and must keep a piece of fat in the bundles along with the corn,\\n\\nand that both must be kept out of sight. In the fall they should take\\n\\nthe ear of corn out of the bundles and rub the piece of fat over it.\\n\\nThus they would have good crops and plenty of food.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll these things the people did, and it was a help to them in their\\n\\nliving.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: WAUKEWA\\'S EAGLE]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 17: By special permission from _The Punishment of the Stingy,_\\n\\nby George Bird Grinnell. Copyright by Harper & Brothers.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWAUKEWA\\'S EAGLE[18]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nONE day, when the Indian boy Waukewa was hunting along the\\n\\nmountain-side, he found a young eagle with a broken wing, lying at the\\n\\nbase of a cliff. The bird had fallen from an aery on a ledge high above,\\n\\nand being too young to fly, had fluttered down the cliff and injured\\n\\nitself so severely that it was likely to die. When Waukewa saw it he was\\n\\nabout to drive one of his sharp arrows through its body, for the passion\\n\\nof the hunter was strong in him, and the eagle plunders many a fine fish\\n\\nfrom the Indian\\'s drying-frame. But a gentler impulse came to him as he\\n\\nsaw the young bird quivering with pain and fright at his feet, and he\\n\\nslowly unbent his bow, put the arrow in his quiver, and stooped over the\\n\\npanting eaglet. For fully a minute the wild eyes of the wounded bird and\\n\\nthe eyes of the Indian boy, growing gentler and softer as he gazed,\\n\\nlooked into one another. Then the struggling and panting of the young\\n\\neagle ceased; the wild, frightened look passed out of its eyes, and it\\n\\nsuffered Waukewa to pass his hand gently over its ruffled and draggled\\n\\nfeathers. The fierce instinct to fight, to defend its threatened life,\\n\\nyielded to the charm of the tenderness and pity expressed in the boy\\'s\\n\\neyes; and from that moment Waukewa and the eagle were friends.\\n\\n\\n\\nWaukewa went slowly home to his father\\'s lodge, bearing the wounded\\n\\neaglet in his arms. He carried it so gently that the broken wing gave no\\n\\ntwinge of pain, and the bird lay perfectly still, never offering to\\n\\nstrike with its sharp beak the hands that clasped it.\\n\\n\\n\\nWarming some water over the fire at the lodge, Waukewa bathed the broken\\n\\nwing of the eagle, and bound it up with soft strips of skin. Then he\\n\\nmade a nest of ferns and grass inside the lodge, and laid the bird in\\n\\nit. The boy\\'s mother looked on with shining eyes. Her heart was very\\n\\ntender. From girlhood she had loved all the creatures of the woods, and\\n\\nit pleased her to see some of her own gentle spirit waking in the boy.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Waukewa\\'s father returned from hunting, he would have caught up the\\n\\nyoung eagle and wrung its neck. But the boy pleaded with him so eagerly,\\n\\nstooping over the captive and defending it with his small hands, that\\n\\nthe stern warrior laughed and called him his \"little squaw-heart.\" \"Keep\\n\\nit, then,\" he said, \"and nurse it until it is well. But then you must\\n\\nlet it go, for we will not raise up a thief in the lodges.\" So Waukewa\\n\\npromised that when the eagle\\'s wing was healed and grown so that it\\n\\ncould fly, he would carry it forth and give it its freedom.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a month--or, as the Indians say, a moon--before the young eagle\\'s\\n\\nwing had fully mended and the bird was old enough and strong enough to\\n\\nfly. And in the meantime Waukewa cared for it and fed it daily, and the\\n\\nfriendship between the boy and the bird grew very strong.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut at last the time came when the willing captive must be freed. So\\n\\nWaukewa carried it far away from the Indian lodges, where none of the\\n\\nyoung braves might see it hovering over and be tempted to shoot their\\n\\narrows at it, and there he let it go. The young eagle rose toward the\\n\\nsky in great circles, rejoicing in its freedom and its strange, new\\n\\npower of flight. But when Waukewa began to move away from the spot, it\\n\\ncame swooping down again; and all day long it followed him through the\\n\\nwoods as he hunted. At dusk, when Waukewa shaped his course for the\\n\\nIndian lodges, the eagle would have accompanied him. But the boy\\n\\nsuddenly slipped into a hollow tree and hid, and after a long time the\\n\\neagle stopped sweeping about in search of him and flew slowly and sadly\\n\\naway.\\n\\n\\n\\nSummer passed, and then winter; and spring came again, with its flowers\\n\\nand birds and swarming fish in the lakes and streams. Then it was that\\n\\nall the Indians, old and young, braves and squaws, pushed their light\\n\\ncanoes out from shore and with spear and hook waged pleasant war against\\n\\nthe salmon and the red-spotted trout. After winter\\'s long imprisonment,\\n\\nit was such joy to toss in the sunshine and the warm wind and catch\\n\\nsavory fish to take the place of dried meats and corn!\\n\\n\\n\\nAbove the great falls of the Apahoqui the salmon sported in the cool,\\n\\nswinging current, darting under the lee of the rocks and leaping full\\n\\nlength in the clear spring air. Nowhere else were such salmon to be\\n\\nspeared as those which lay among the riffles at the head of the Apahoqui\\n\\nrapids. But only the most daring braves ventured to seek them there, for\\n\\nthe current was strong, and should a light canoe once pass the\\n\\ndanger-point and get caught in the rush of the rapids, nothing could\\n\\nsave it from going over the roaring falls.\\n\\n\\n\\nVery early in the morning of a clear April day, just as the sun was\\n\\nrising splendidly over the mountains, Waukewa launched his canoe a\\n\\nhalf-mile above the rapids of the Apahoqui, and floated downward, spear\\n\\nin hand, among the salmon-riffles. He was the only one of the Indian\\n\\nlads who dared fish above the falls. But he had been there often, and\\n\\nnever yet had his watchful eye and his strong paddle suffered the\\n\\ncurrent to carry his canoe beyond the danger-point. This morning he was\\n\\nalone on the river, having risen long before daylight to be first at the\\n\\nsport.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe riffles were full of salmon, big, lusty fellows, who glided about\\n\\nthe canoe on every side in an endless silver stream. Waukewa plunged his\\n\\nspear right and left, and tossed one glittering victim after another\\n\\ninto the bark canoe. So absorbed in the sport was he that for once he\\n\\ndid not notice when the canoe began to glide more swiftly among the\\n\\nrocks. But suddenly he looked up, caught his paddle, and dipped it\\n\\nwildly in the swirling water. The canoe swung sidewise, shivered, held\\n\\nits own against the torrent, and then slowly, inch by inch, began to\\n\\ncreep upstream toward the shore. But suddenly there was a loud, cruel\\n\\nsnap, and the paddle parted in the boy\\'s hands, broken just above the\\n\\nblade! Waukewa gave a cry of despairing agony. Then he bent to the\\n\\ngunwale of his canoe and with the shattered blade fought desperately\\n\\nagainst the current. But it was useless. The racing torrent swept him\\n\\ndownward; the hungry falls roared tauntingly in his ears.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the Indian boy knelt calmly upright in the canoe, facing the mist\\n\\nof the falls, and folded his arms. His young face was stern and lofty.\\n\\nHe had lived like a brave hitherto--now he would die like one.\\n\\n\\n\\nFaster and faster sped the doomed canoe toward the great cataract. The\\n\\nblack rocks glided away on either side like phantoms. The roar of the\\n\\nterrible waters became like thunder in the boy\\'s ears. But still he\\n\\ngazed calmly and sternly ahead, facing his fate as a brave Indian\\n\\nshould. At last he began to chant the death-song, which he had learned\\n\\nfrom the older braves. In a few moments all would be over. But he would\\n\\ncome before the Great Spirit with a fearless hymn upon his lips.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly a shadow fell across the canoe. Waukewa lifted his eyes and saw\\n\\na great eagle hovering over, with dangling legs, and a spread of wings\\n\\nthat blotted out the sun. Once more the eyes of the Indian boy and the\\n\\neagle met; and now it was the eagle who was master!\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a glad cry the Indian boy stood up in his canoe, and the eagle\\n\\nhovered lower. Now the canoe tossed up on that great swelling wave that\\n\\nclimbs to the cataract\\'s edge, and the boy lifted his hands and caught\\n\\nthe legs of the eagle. The next moment he looked down into the awful\\n\\ngulf of waters from its very verge. The canoe was snatched from beneath\\n\\nhim and plunged down the black wall of the cataract; but he and the\\n\\nstruggling eagle were floating outward and downwards through the cloud\\n\\nof mist. The cataract roared terribly, like a wild beast robbed of its\\n\\nprey. The spray beat and blinded, the air rushed upward as they fell.\\n\\nBut the eagle struggled on with his burden. He fought his way out of the\\n\\nmist and the flying spray. His great wings threshed the air with a\\n\\nwhistling sound. Down, down they sank, the boy and the eagle, but ever\\n\\nfarther from the precipice of water and the boiling whirlpool below. At\\n\\nlength, with a fluttering plunge, the eagle dropped on a sand-bar below\\n\\nthe whirlpool, and he and the Indian boy lay there a minute, breathless\\n\\nand exhausted. Then the eagle slowly lifted himself, took the air under\\n\\nhis free wings, and soared away, while the Indian boy knelt on the sand,\\n\\nwith shining eyes following the great bird till he faded into the gray\\n\\nof the cliffs.\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 18: By permission from Waukewa\\'s Eagle, by James Buckham, in\\n\\n_St. Nicholas_, Vol. XXVIII, Part I, The Century Company.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHALLOWE\\'EN AND MYSTERY STORIES\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: THE ROLL-CALL OF THE REEF]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE ROLL-CALL OF THE REEF[19]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"YES, sir,\" said my host the quarryman, reaching down the relics from\\n\\ntheir hook in the wall over the chimney-piece; \"they\\'ve hung there all\\n\\nmy time, and most of my father\\'s. The women won\\'t touch \\'em; they\\'re\\n\\nafraid of the story. So here they\\'ll dangle, and gather dust and smoke,\\n\\ntill another tenant comes and tosses \\'em out o\\' doors for rubbish. Whew!\\n\\n\\'tis coarse weather.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe went to the door, opened it, and stood studying the gale that beat\\n\\nupon his cottage-front, straight from the Manacle Reef. The rain drove\\n\\npast him into the kitchen aslant like threads of gold silk in the shine\\n\\nof the wreckwood fire. Meanwhile by the same firelight I examined the\\n\\nrelics on my knee. The metal of each was tarnished out of knowledge. But\\n\\nthe trumpet was evidently an old cavalry trumpet, and the threads of its\\n\\nparti-colored sling, though frayed and dusty, still hung together.\\n\\nAround the side-drum, beneath its cracked brown varnish, I could hardly\\n\\ntrace a royal coat-of-arms and a legend running, _Per Mare per\\n\\nTerram_--the motto of the Marines. Its parchment, though colored and\\n\\nscented with wood-smoke, was limp and mildewed, and I began to tighten\\n\\nup the straps--under which the drum-sticks had been loosely thrust\\n\\n--with the idle purpose of trying if some music might be got out of the\\n\\nold drum yet.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut as I turned it on my knee, I found the drum attached to the\\n\\ntrumpet-sling by a curious barrel-shaped padlock, and paused to examine\\n\\nthis. The body of the lock was composed of half a dozen brass rings, set\\n\\naccurately edge to edge; and, rubbing the brass with my thumb, I saw\\n\\nthat each of the six had a series of letters engraved around it.\\n\\n\\n\\nI knew the trick of it, I thought. Here was one of those word padlocks,\\n\\nonce so common; only to be opened by getting the rings to spell a\\n\\ncertain word, which the dealer confides to you.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy host shut and barred the door, and came back to the hearth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Twas just such a wind--east by south--that brought in what you\\'ve got\\n\\nbetween your hands. Back in the year \\'nine it was; my father has told me\\n\\nthe tale a score o\\' times. You\\'re twisting round the rings, I see. But\\n\\nyou\\'ll never guess the word. Parson Kendall, he made the word, and\\n\\nknocked down a couple o\\' ghosts in their graves with it, and when his\\n\\ntime came, he went to his own grave and took the word with him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Whose ghosts, Matthew?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You want the story, I see, sir. My father could tell it better than I\\n\\ncan. He was a young man in the year \\'nine, unmarried at the time, and\\n\\nliving in this very cottage just as I be. That\\'s how he came to get\\n\\nmixed up with the tale.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe took a chair, lit a short pipe, and unfolded the story in a low\\n\\nmusing voice, with his eyes fixed on the dancing violet flames.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, he\\'d ha\\' been about thirty year old in January of the year \\'nine.\\n\\nThe storm got up in the night o\\' the twenty-first o\\' that month. My\\n\\nfather was dressed and out long before daylight; he never was one to\\n\\n\\'bide in bed, let be that the gale by this time was pretty near lifting\\n\\nthe thatch over his head. Besides which, he\\'d fenced a small \\'taty-patch\\n\\nthat winter, down by Lowland Point, and he wanted to see if it stood the\\n\\nnight\\'s work. He took the path across Gunner\\'s Meadow--where they buried\\n\\nmost of the bodies afterward. The wind was right in his teeth at the\\n\\ntime, and once on the way (he\\'s told me this often) a great strip of\\n\\nore-weed came flying through the darkness and fetched him a slap on the\\n\\ncheek like a cold hand. But he made shift pretty well till he got to\\n\\nLowland, and then had to drop upon his hands and knees and crawl,\\n\\ndigging his fingers every now and then into the shingle to hold on, for\\n\\nhe declared to me that the stones, some of them as big as a man\\'s head,\\n\\nkept rolling and driving past till it seemed the whole foreshore was\\n\\nmoving westward under him. The fence was gone, of course; not a stick\\n\\nleft to show where it stood; so that, when first he came to the place,\\n\\nhe thought he must have missed his bearings. My father, sir, was a very\\n\\nreligious man; and if he reckoned the end of the world was at\\n\\nhand--there in the great wind and night, among the moving stones--you\\n\\nmay believe he was certain of it when he heard a gun fired, and, with\\n\\nthe same, saw a flame shoot up out of the darkness to windward, making a\\n\\nsudden fierce light in all the place about. All he could find to think\\n\\nor say was, \\'The Second Coming--The Second Coming! The Bridegroom\\n\\ncometh, and the wicked He will toss like a ball into a large country!\\'\\n\\nand being already upon his knees, he just bowed his head and \\'bided,\\n\\nsaying this over and over.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But by\\'m-by, between two squalls, he made bold to lift his head and\\n\\nlook, and then by the light--a bluish color \\'twas--he saw all the coast\\n\\nclear away to Manacle Point, and off the Manacles, in the thick of the\\n\\nweather, a sloop-of-war with top-gallants housed, driving stern foremost\\n\\ntoward the reef. It was she, of course, that was burning the flare. My\\n\\nfather could see the white streak and the ports of her quite plain as\\n\\nshe rose to it, a little outside the breakers, and he guessed easy\\n\\nenough that her captain had just managed to wear ship, and was trying to\\n\\nforce her nose to the sea with the help of her small bower anchor and\\n\\nthe scrap or two of canvas that hadn\\'t yet been blown out of her. But\\n\\nwhile he looked, she fell off, giving her broadside to it foot by foot,\\n\\nand drifting back on the breakers around Carn du and the Varses. The\\n\\nrocks lie so thick thereabouts, that \\'twas a toss up which she struck\\n\\nfirst; at any rate, my father couldn\\'t tell at the time, for just then\\n\\nthe flare died down and went out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, sir, he turned then in the dark and started back for Coverack to\\n\\ncry the dismal tidings--though well knowing ship and crew to be past any\\n\\nhope; and as he turned, the wind lifted him and tossed him forward \\'like\\n\\na ball,\\' as he\\'d been saying, and homeward along the foreshore. As you\\n\\nknow, \\'tis ugly work, even by daylight, picking your way among the\\n\\nstones there, and my father was prettily knocked about at first in the\\n\\ndark. But by this \\'twas nearer seven than six o\\'clock, and the day\\n\\nspreading. By the time he reached North Corner, a man could see to read\\n\\nprint; hows\\'ever he looked neither out to sea nor toward Coverack, but\\n\\nheaded straight for the first cottage--the same that stands above North\\n\\nCorner to-day. A man named Billy Ede lived there then, and when my\\n\\nfather burst into the kitchen bawling, \\'Wreck! wreck!\\' he saw Billy\\n\\nEde\\'s wife, Ann, standing there in her clogs, with a shawl over her\\n\\nhead, and her clothes wringing wet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Save the chap!\\' says Billy Ede\\'s wife, Ann. \\'What d\\' \\'ee means by\\n\\ncrying stale fish at that rate?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'But \\'tis a wreck. I tell \\'ee. I\\'ve azeed\\'n!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Why, so \\'tis,\\' says she, \\'and I\\'ve azeed\\'n, too; and so has every one\\n\\nwith an eye in his head.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And with that she pointed straight over my father\\'s shoulder, and he\\n\\nturned: and there, close under Dolor Point, at the end of Coverack town,\\n\\nhe saw another wreck washing, and the Point black with people, like\\n\\nemmets, running to and fro in the morning light. While we stood staring\\n\\nat her, he heard a trumpet sounded on board, the notes coming in little\\n\\njerks, like a bird rising against the wind; but faintly, of course,\\n\\nbecause of the distance and the gale blowing--though this had dropped a\\n\\nlittle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'She\\'s a transport,\\' said Billy Ede\\'s wife, Ann, \\'and full of horse\\n\\nsoldiers, fine long men. When she struck they must ha\\' pitched the\\n\\nhosses over first to lighten the ship, for a score of dead hosses had\\n\\nwashed in afore I left, half an hour back. An\\' three or four soldiers,\\n\\ntoo--fine long corpses in white breeches and jackets of blue and gold. I\\n\\nheld the lantern to one. Such a straight young man.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My father asked her about the trumpeting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'That\\'s the queerest bit of all. She was burnin\\' a light when me an\\' my\\n\\nman joined the crowd down there. All her masts had gone; whether they\\n\\nwere carried away, or were cut away to ease her, I don\\'t rightly know.\\n\\nAnyway, there she lay \\'pon the rocks with her decks bare. Her keelson\\n\\nwas broke under her and her bottom sagged and stove, and she had just\\n\\nsettled down like a sitting hen--just the leastest list to starboard;\\n\\nbut a man could stand there easy. They had rigged up ropes across her,\\n\\nfrom bulwark to bulwark, an\\' beside these the men were mustered, holding\\n\\non like grim death whenever the sea made a clean breach over them, an\\'\\n\\nstanding up like heroes as soon as it passed. The captain an\\' the\\n\\nofficers were clinging to the rail of the quarter-deck, all in their\\n\\ngolden uniforms, waiting for the end as if \\'twas King George they\\n\\nexpected. There was no way to help, for she lay right beyond cast of\\n\\nline, though our folk tried it fifty times. And beside them clung a\\n\\ntrumpeter, a whacking big man, an\\' between the heavy seas he would lift\\n\\nhis trumpet with one hand, and blow a call; and every time he blew the\\n\\nmen gave a cheer. There (she says)--hark \\'ee now--there he goes agen!\\n\\nBut you won\\'t hear no cheering any more, for few are left to cheer, and\\n\\ntheir voices weak. Bitter cold the wind is, and I reckon it numbs their\\n\\ngrip o\\' the ropes, for they were dropping off fast with every sea when\\n\\nmy man sent me home to get his breakfast. Another wreck, you say? Well,\\n\\nthere\\'s no hope for the tender dears, if \\'tis the Manacles. You\\'d better\\n\\nrun down and help yonder; though \\'tis little help that any man can give.\\n\\nNot one came in alive while I was there. The tide\\'s flowing, an\\' she\\n\\nwon\\'t hold together another hour, they say.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, sure enough, the end was coming fast when my father got down to\\n\\nthe point. Six men had been cast up alive, or just breathing--a seaman\\n\\nand five troopers. The seaman was the only one that had breath to speak;\\n\\nand while they were carrying him into the town, the word went round\\n\\nthat the ship\\'s name was the Despatch, transport, homeward bound from\\n\\nCorunna, with a detachment of the 7th Hussars, that had been fighting\\n\\nout there with Sir John Moore. The seas had rolled her farther over by\\n\\nthis time, and given her decks a pretty sharp slope; but a dozen men\\n\\nstill held on, seven by the ropes near the ship\\'s waist, a couple near\\n\\nthe break of the poop, and three on the quarter-deck. Of these three my\\n\\nfather made out one to be the skipper; close by him clung an officer in\\n\\nfull regimentals--his name, they heard after, was Captain Duncanfield;\\n\\nand last came the tall trumpeter; and if you\\'ll believe me, the fellow\\n\\nwas making shift there, at the very last, to blow _\\'God Save the King.\\'_\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, he got to _\\'Send Us Victorious\\'_ before an extra big sea\\n\\ncame bursting across and washed them off the deck--every man but one of\\n\\nthe pair beneath the poop--and _he_ dropped his hold before the next\\n\\nwave; being stunned, I reckon. The others went out of sight at once, but\\n\\nthe trumpeter--being, as I said, a powerful man as well as a tough\\n\\nswimmer--rose like a duck, rode out a couple of breakers, and came in on\\n\\nthe crest of the third. The folks looked to see him broke like an egg at\\n\\ntheir feet; but when the smother cleared, there he was, lying face\\n\\ndownward on a ledge below them; and one of the men that happened to have\\n\\na rope round him--I forget the fellow\\'s name, if I ever heard it--jumped\\n\\ndown and grabbed him by the ankle as he began to slip back. Before the\\n\\nnext big sea, the pair were hauled high enough to be out of harm, and\\n\\nanother heave brought them up to grass. Quick work; but master trumpeter\\n\\nwasn\\'t quite dead! nothing worse than a cracked head and three staved\\n\\nribs. In twenty minutes or so they had him in bed, with the doctor to\\n\\ntend him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now was the time--nothing being left alive upon the transport--for my\\n\\nfather to tell of the sloop he\\'d seen driving upon the Manacles. And\\n\\nwhen he got a hearing, though the most were set upon salvage, and\\n\\nbelieved a wreck in the hand, so to say, to be worth half a dozen they\\n\\ncouldn\\'t see, a good few volunteered to start off with him and have a\\n\\nlook. They crossed Lowland Point; no ship to be seen on the Manacles,\\n\\nnor anywhere upon the sea. One or two was for calling my father a liar.\\n\\n\\'Wait till we come to Dean Point,\\' said he. Sure enough, on the far side\\n\\nof Dean Point, they found the sloop\\'s mainmast washing about with half a\\n\\ndozen men lashed to it--men in red jackets--every mother\\'s son drowned\\n\\nand staring; and a little farther on, just under the Dean, three or\\n\\nfour bodies cast up on the shore, one of them a small drummer-boy,\\n\\nside-drum and all; and, near by, part of a ship\\'s gig, with \\'H. M. S.\\n\\nPrimrose\\' cut on the stern-board. From this point on, the shore was\\n\\nlittered thick with wreckage and dead bodies--the most of them marines\\n\\nin uniform; and in Godrevy Cove in particular, a heap of furniture from\\n\\nthe captain\\'s cabin, and among it a water-tight box, not much damaged,\\n\\nand full of papers, by which, when it came to be examined next day, the\\n\\nwreck was easily made out to be the Primrose of eighteen guns, outward\\n\\nbound from Portsmouth, with a fleet of transports for the Spanish War,\\n\\nthirty sail, I\\'ve heard, but I\\'ve never heard what became of them. Being\\n\\nhandled by merchant skippers, no doubt they rode out the gale and\\n\\nreached the Tagus safe and sound. Not but what the captain of the\\n\\nPrimrose (Mein was his name) did quite right to try and club-haul his\\n\\nvessel when he found himself under the land; only he never ought to have\\n\\ngot there if he took proper soundings. But it\\'s easy talking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The Primrose, sir, was a handsome vessel--for her size, one of the\\n\\nhandsomest in the King\\'s service--and newly fitted out at Plymouth Dock.\\n\\nSo the boys had brave pickings from her in the way of brass-work,\\n\\nship\\'s instruments, and the like, let alone some barrels of stores not\\n\\nmuch spoiled. They loaded themselves with as much as they could carry,\\n\\nand started for home, meaning to make a second journey before the\\n\\npreventive men got wind of their doings and came to spoil the fun. But\\n\\nas my father was passing back under the Dean, he happened to take a look\\n\\nover his shoulder at the bodies there. \\'Hullo,\\' says he, and dropped his\\n\\ngear, \\'I do believe there\\'s a leg moving!\\' And, running fore, he stooped\\n\\nover the small drummer-boy that I told you about. The poor little chap\\n\\nwas lying there, with his face a mass of bruises and his eyes closed:\\n\\nbut he had shifted one leg an inch or two, and was still breathing. So\\n\\nmy father pulled out a knife and cut him free from his drum--that was\\n\\nlashed on to him with a double turn of Manilla rope--and took him up and\\n\\ncarried him along here, to this very room that we\\'re sitting in. He lost\\n\\na good deal by this, for when he went back to fetch his bundle the\\n\\npreventive men had got hold of it, and were thick as thieves along the\\n\\nforeshore; so that \\'twas only by paying one or two to look the other way\\n\\nthat he picked up anything worth carrying off: which you\\'ll allow to be\\n\\nhard, seeing that he was the first man to give news of the wreck.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, the inquiry was held, of course, and my father gave evidence, and\\n\\nfor the rest they had to trust to the sloop\\'s papers, for not a soul was\\n\\nsaved besides the drummer-boy, and he was raving in a fever, brought on\\n\\nby the cold and the fright. And the seamen and the five troopers gave\\n\\nevidence about the loss of the Despatch. The tall trumpeter, too, whose\\n\\nribs were healing, came forward and kissed the book; but somehow his\\n\\nhead had been hurt in coming ashore, and he talked foolish-like, and\\n\\n\\'twas easy seen he would never be a proper man again. The others were\\n\\ntaken up to Plymouth, and so went their ways; but the trumpeter stayed\\n\\non in Coverick; and King George, finding he was fit for nothing, sent\\n\\nhim down a trifle of a pension after a while--enough to keep him in\\n\\nboard and lodging, with a bit of tobacco over.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now the first time that this man--William Tallifer, he called\\n\\nhimself--met with the drummer-boy, was about a fortnight after the\\n\\nlittle chap had bettered enough to be allowed a short walk out of doors,\\n\\nwhich he took, if you please, in full regimentals. There never was a\\n\\nsoldier so proud of his dress. His own suit had shrunk a brave bit with\\n\\nthe salt water; but into ordinary frock an\\' corduroys he declared he\\n\\nwould not get--not if he had to go naked the rest of his life; so my\\n\\nfather, being a good-natured man and handy with the needle, turned to\\n\\nand repaired damages with a piece or two of scarlet cloth cut from the\\n\\njacket of one of the drowned Marines. Well, the poor little chap chanced\\n\\nto be standing, in this rig-out, down by the gate of Gunner\\'s Meadow,\\n\\nwhere they had buried two-score and over of his comrades. The morning\\n\\nwas a fine one, early in March month; and along came the cracked\\n\\ntrumpeter, likewise taking a stroll.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Hullo!\\' says he; \\'good-mornin\\'! And what might you be doin\\' here?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'I was a-wishin\\',\\' says the boy, \\'I had a pair o\\' drumsticks. Our lads\\n\\nwere buried yonder without so much as a drum tapped or a musket fired;\\n\\nand that\\'s not Christian burial for British soldiers.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Phut!\\' says the trumpeter, and spat on the ground; \\'a parcel of\\n\\nMarines!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The boy eyed him a second or so, but answered up: \\'If I\\'d a tab of turf\\n\\nhandy, I\\'d bung it at your mouth, you greasy cavalryman, and learn you\\n\\nto speak respectful of your betters. The Marines are the handiest body\\n\\nof men in the service.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The trumpeter looked down on him from the height of six foot two, and\\n\\nasked: \\'Did they die well?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'They died very well. There was a lot of running to and fro at first,\\n\\nand some of the men began to cry, and a few to strip off their clothes.\\n\\nBut when the ship fell off for the last time, Captain Mein turned and\\n\\nsaid something to Major Griffiths, the commanding officer on board, and\\n\\nthe Major called out to me to beat to quarters. It might have been for a\\n\\nwedding, he sang it out so cheerful. We\\'d had word already that \\'twas to\\n\\nbe parade order, and the men fell in as trim and decent as if they were\\n\\ngoing to church. One or two even tried to shave at the last moment. The\\n\\nMajor wore his medals. One of the seamen, seeing that I had hard work to\\n\\nkeep the drum steady--the sling being a bit loose for me and the wind\\n\\nwhat you remember--lashed it tight with a piece of rope; and that saved\\n\\nmy life afterward, a drum being as good as a cork until it\\'s stove. I\\n\\nkept beating away until every man was on deck; and then the Major formed\\n\\nthem up and told them to die like British soldiers, and the chaplain\\n\\nread a prayer or two--the boys standin\\' all the while like rocks, each\\n\\nman\\'s courage keeping up the other\\'s. The chaplain was in the middle of\\n\\na prayer when she struck. In ten minutes she was gone. That was how they\\n\\ndied, cavalryman.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'And that was very well done, drummer of the Marines. What\\'s your\\n\\nname?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'John Christian.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Mine\\'s William George Tallifer, trumpeter, of the 7th Light\\n\\nDragoons--the Queen\\'s Own. I played _\\'God Save the King\\'_ while our men\\n\\nwere drowning. Captain Duncanfield told me to sound a call or two, to\\n\\nput them in heart; but that matter of _\\'God Save the King\\'_ was a notion\\n\\nof my own. I won\\'t say anything to hurt the feelings of a Marine, even\\n\\nif he\\'s not much over five foot tall; but the Queen\\'s Own Hussars is a\\n\\ntearin\\' fine regiment. As between horse and foot \\'tis a question o\\'\\n\\nwhich gets the chance. All the way from Sahagun to Corunna \\'twas we that\\n\\ntook and gave the knocks--at Mayorga and Rueda and Bennyventy.\\' (The\\n\\nreason, sir, I can speak the names so pat is that my father learnt \\'em\\n\\nby heart afterward from the trumpeter, who was always talking about\\n\\nMayorga and Rueda and Bennyventy.) \\'We made the rearguard, under General\\n\\nPaget, and drove the French every time; and all the infantry did was to\\n\\nsit about in wine-shops till we whipped \\'em out, an\\' steal an\\' straggle\\n\\nan\\' play the tom-fool in general. And when it came to a stand-up fight\\n\\nat Corunna, \\'twas we that had to stay sea-sick aboard the transports,\\n\\nan\\' watch the infantry in the thick o\\' the caper. Very well they\\n\\nbehaved, too; \\'specially the 4th Regiment, an\\' the 42d Highlanders, an\\'\\n\\nthe Dirty Half-Hundred. Oh, ay; they\\'re decent regiments, all three. But\\n\\nthe Queen\\'s Own Hussars is a tearin\\' fine regiment. So you played on\\n\\nyour drum when the ship was goin\\' down? Drummer John Christian, I\\'ll\\n\\nhave to get you a new pair o\\' drum-sticks for that.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, sir, it appears that the very next day the trumpeter marched into\\n\\nHelston, and got a carpenter there to turn him a pair of box-wood\\n\\ndrum-sticks for the boy. And this was the beginning of one of the most\\n\\ncurious friendships you ever heard tell of. Nothing delighted the pair\\n\\nmore than to borrow a boat of my father and pull out to the rocks where\\n\\nthe Primrose and the Despatch had struck and sunk; and on still days\\n\\n\\'twas pretty to hear them out there off the Manacles, the drummer\\n\\nplaying his tattoo--for they always took their music with them--and the\\n\\ntrumpeter practising calls, and making his trumpet speak like an angel.\\n\\nBut if the weather turned roughish, they\\'d be walking together and\\n\\ntalking; leastwise, the youngster listened while the other discoursed\\n\\nabout Sir John\\'s campaign in Spain and Portugal, telling how each little\\n\\nskirmish befell; and of Sir John himself, and General Baird and General\\n\\nPaget, and Colonel Vivian his own commanding officer, and what kind men\\n\\nthey were; and of the last bloody stand-up at Corunna, and so forth, as\\n\\nif neither could have enough.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But all this had to come to an end in the late summer, for the boy,\\n\\nJohn Christian, being now well and strong again, must go up to Plymouth\\n\\nto report himself. \\'Twas his own wish (for I believe King George had\\n\\nforgotten all about him), but his friend wouldn\\'t hold him back. As for\\n\\nthe trumpeter, my father had made an arrangement to take him on as a\\n\\nlodger as soon as the boy left; and on the morning fixed for the start\\n\\nhe was up at the door here by five o\\'clock, with his trumpet slung by\\n\\nhis side, and all the rest of his belongings in a small valise. A Monday\\n\\nmorning it was, and after breakfast he had fixed to walk with the boy\\n\\nsome way on the road toward Helston, where the coach started. My father\\n\\nleft them at breakfast together, and went out to meat the pig, and do a\\n\\nfew odd morning jobs of that sort. When he came back, the boy was still\\n\\nat table, and the trumpeter standing here by the chimney-place with the\\n\\ndrum and trumpet in his hands, hitched together just as they be at this\\n\\nmoment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Look at this,\\' he says to my father, showing him the lock; \\'I picked\\n\\nit up off a starving brass-worker in Lisbon, and it is not one of your\\n\\ncommon locks that one word of six letters will open at any time. There\\'s\\n\\n_janius_ in this lock; for you\\'ve only to make the ring spell any\\n\\nsix-letter word you please, and snap down the lock upon that, and never\\n\\na soul can open it--not the maker, even--until somebody comes along that\\n\\nknows the word you snapped it on. Now, Johnny, here\\'s goin\\', and he\\n\\nleaves his drum behind him; for, though he can make pretty music on it,\\n\\nthe parchment sags in wet weather, by reason of the sea-water getting at\\n\\nit; an\\' if he carries it to Plymouth, they\\'ll only condemn it and give\\n\\nhim another. And as for me, I shan\\'t have the heart to put lip to the\\n\\ntrumpet any more when Johnny\\'s gone. So we\\'ve chosen a word together,\\n\\nand locked \\'em together upon that; and, by your leave, I\\'ll hang \\'em\\n\\nhere together on the hook over your fireplace. Maybe Johnny\\'ll come\\n\\nback; maybe not. Maybe, if he comes, I\\'ll be dead an\\' gone, an\\' he\\'ll\\n\\ntake \\'em apart an\\' try their music for old sake\\'s sake. But if he never\\n\\ncomes, nobody can separate \\'em; for nobody besides knows the word. And\\n\\nif you marry and have sons, you can tell \\'em that here are tied together\\n\\nthe souls of Johnny Christian, drummer, of the Marines, and William\\n\\nGeorge Tallifer, once trumpeter of the Queen\\'s Own Hussars. Amen.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"With that he hung the two instruments \\'pon the hook there; and the boy\\n\\nstood up and thanked my father and shook hands; and the pair went forth\\n\\nof the door, toward Helston.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Somewhere on the road they took leave of one another; but nobody saw\\n\\nthe parting, nor heard what was said between them. About three in the\\n\\nafternoon the trumpeter came walking back over the hill; and by the time\\n\\nmy father came home from the fishing, the cottage was tidied up and the\\n\\ntea ready, and the whole place shining like a new pin. From that time\\n\\nfor five years he lodged here with my father, looking after the house\\n\\nand tilling the garden; and all the while he was steadily failing, the\\n\\nhurt in his head spreading, in a manner, to his limbs. My father watched\\n\\nthe feebleness growing on him, but said nothing. And from first to last\\n\\nneither spake a word about the drummer, John Christian; nor did any\\n\\nletter reach them, nor word of his doings.\\n\\n\\n\\n     \"The rest of the tale you\\'m free to believe, sir, or not, as you\\n\\n     please. It stands upon my father\\'s words, and he always declared he\\n\\n     was ready to kiss the Book upon it before judge and jury. He said,\\n\\n     too, that he never had the wit to make up such a yarn; and he\\n\\n     defied any one to explain about the lock, in particular, by any\\n\\n     other tale. But you shall judge for yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My father said that about three o\\'clock in the morning, April\\n\\nfourteenth of the year \\'fourteen, he and William Tallifer were sitting\\n\\nhere, just as you and I, sir, are sitting now. My father had put on his\\n\\nclothes a few minutes before, and was mending his spiller by the light\\n\\nof the horn lantern, meaning to set off before daylight to haul the\\n\\ntrammel. The trumpeter hadn\\'t been to bed at all. Toward the last he\\n\\nmostly spent his nights (and his days, too) dozing in the elbow-chair\\n\\nwhere you sit at this minute. He was dozing then (my father said), with\\n\\nhis chin dropped forward on his chest, when a knock sounded upon the\\n\\ndoor, and the door opened, and in walked an upright young man in scarlet\\n\\nregimentals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He had grown a brave bit, and his face was the color of wood-ashes; but\\n\\nit was the drummer, John Christian. Only his uniform was different from\\n\\nthe one he used to wear, and the figures \\'38\\' shone in brass upon his\\n\\ncollar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The drummer walked past my father as if he never saw him, and stood by\\n\\nthe elbow-chair and said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Trumpeter, trumpeter, are you one with me?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And the trumpeter just lifted the lids of his eyes, and answered, \\'How\\n\\nshould I not be one with you, drummer Johnny--Johnny boy? The men are\\n\\npatient. \\'Til you come, I count; you march, I mark time until the\\n\\ndischarge comes.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'The discharge has come to-night,\\' said the drummer, \\'and the word is\\n\\nCorunna no longer;\\' and stepping to the chimney-place, he unhooked the\\n\\ndrum and trumpet, and began to twist the brass rings of the lock,\\n\\nspelling the word aloud, so--C-O-R-U-N-A. When he had fixed the last\\n\\nletter, the padlock opened in his hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Did you know, trumpeter, that when I came to Plymouth they put me into\\n\\na line regiment.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'The 38th is a good regiment,\\' answered the old Hussar, still in his\\n\\ndull voice. \\'I went back with them from Sahagun to Corunna. At Corunna\\n\\nthey stood in General Fraser\\'s division, on the right. They behaved\\n\\nwell.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'But I\\'d fain see the Marines again,\\' says the drummer, handing him the\\n\\ntrumpet, \\'and you--you shall call once more for the Queen\\'s Own.\\n\\nMatthew,\\' he says, suddenly, turning on my father--and when he turned,\\n\\nmy father saw for the first time that his scarlet jacket had a round\\n\\nhole by the breast-bone, and that the blood was welling there--\\'Matthew,\\n\\nwe shall want your boat.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then my father rose on his legs like a man in a dream, while they two\\n\\nslung on, the one his drum, and t\\'other his trumpet. He took the\\n\\nlantern, and went quaking before them down to the shore, and they\\n\\nbreathed heavily behind him; and they stepped into his boat, and my\\n\\nfather pushed off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Row you first for Dolor Point,\\' says the drummer. So my father rowed\\n\\nthem out past the white houses of Coverack to Dolor Point, and there, at\\n\\na word, lay on his oars. And the trumpeter, William Tallifer, put his\\n\\ntrumpet to his mouth and sounded the _Revelly_. The music of it was like\\n\\nrivers running.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'They will follow,\\' said the drummer. \\'Matthew, pull you now for the\\n\\nManacles.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So my father pulled for the Manacles, and came to an easy close outside\\n\\nCarn du. And the drummer took his sticks and beat a tattoo, there by the\\n\\nedge of the reef; and the music of it was like a rolling chariot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'That will do,\\' says he, breaking off; \\'they will follow. Pull now for\\n\\nthe shore under Gunner\\'s Meadow.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then my father pulled for the shore, and ran his boat in under Gunner\\'s\\n\\nMeadow. And they stepped out, all three, and walked up to the meadow. By\\n\\nthe gate the drummer halted and began his tattoo again, looking out\\n\\ntoward the darkness over the sea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And while the drum beat, and my father held his breath, there came up\\n\\nout of the sea and the darkness a troop of many men, horse and foot, and\\n\\nformed up among the graves; and others rose out of the graves and formed\\n\\nup--drowned Marines with bleached faces, and pale Hussars riding their\\n\\nhorses, all lean and shadowy. There was no clatter of hoofs or\\n\\naccoutrements, my father said, but a soft sound all the while, like the\\n\\nbeating of a bird\\'s wing and a black shadow lying like a pool about the\\n\\nfeet of all. The drummer stood upon a little knoll just inside the gate,\\n\\nand beside him the tall trumpeter, with hand on hip, watching them\\n\\ngather; and behind them both my father, clinging to the gate. When no\\n\\nmore came the drummer stopped playing, and said, \\'Call the roll.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then the trumpeter stepped toward the end man of the rank and called,\\n\\n\\'Troop-Sergeant-Major Thomas Irons,\\' and the man in a thin voice\\n\\nanswered, \\'Here!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Troop-Sergeant-Major Thomas Irons, how is it with you?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The man answered, \\'How should it be with me? When I was young, I\\n\\nbetrayed a girl; and when I was grown, I betrayed a friend, and for\\n\\nthese things I must pay. But I died as a man ought. God save the King!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The trumpeter called to the next man, \\'Trooper Henry Buckingham\\', and\\n\\nthe next man answered, \\'Here!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Trooper Henry Buckingham, how is it with you?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'How should it be with me? I was a drunkard, and I stole, and in Lugo,\\n\\nin a wine-shop, I knifed a man. But I died as a man should. God save the\\n\\nKing!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So the trumpeter went down the line; and when he had finished, the\\n\\ndrummer took it up, hailing the dead Marines in their order. Each man\\n\\nanswered to his name, and each man ended with \\'God save the King!\\' When\\n\\nall were hailed, the drummer stepped back to his mound, and called:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'It is well. You are content, and we are content to join you. Wait yet\\n\\na little while.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"With this he turned and ordered my father to pick up the lantern, and\\n\\nlead the way back. As my father picked it up, he heard the ranks of\\n\\ndead men cheer and call, \\'God save the King!\\' all together, and saw them\\n\\nwaver and fade back into the dark, like a breath fading off a pane.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But when they came back here to the kitchen, and my father set the\\n\\nlantern down, it seemed they\\'d both forgot about him. For the drummer\\n\\nturned in the lantern-light--and my father could see the blood still\\n\\nwelling out of the hole in his breast--and took the trumpet-sling from\\n\\naround the other\\'s neck, and locked drum and trumpet together again,\\n\\nchoosing the letters on the lock very carefully. While he did this he\\n\\nsaid:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'The word is no more Corunna, but Bayonne. As you left out an \"n\" in\\n\\nCorunna, so must I leave out an \"n\" in Bayonne.\\' And before snapping the\\n\\npadlock, he spelt out the word slowly--\\'B-A-Y-O-N-E.\\' After that, he\\n\\nused no more speech; but turned and hung the two instruments back on the\\n\\nhook; and then took the trumpeter by the arm; and the pair walked out\\n\\ninto the darkness, glancing neither to right nor left.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My father was on the point of following, when he heard a sort of sigh\\n\\nbehind him; and there, sitting in the elbow-chair, was the very\\n\\ntrumpeter he had just seen walk out by the door! If my father\\'s heart\\n\\njumped before, you may believe it jumped quicker now. But after a bit,\\n\\nhe went up to the man asleep in the chair, and put a hand upon him. It\\n\\nwas the trumpeter in flesh and blood that he touched; but though the\\n\\nflesh was warm, the trumpeter was dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, sir, they buried him three days after; and at first my father was\\n\\nminded to say nothing about his dream (as he thought it). But the day\\n\\nafter the funeral, he met Parson Kendall coming from Helston market: and\\n\\nthe parson called out: \\'Have \\'ee heard the news the coach brought down\\n\\nthis mornin\\'?\\' \\'What news?\\' says my father. \\'Why, that peace is agreed\\n\\nupon.\\' \\'None too soon,\\' says my father. \\'Not soon enough for our poor\\n\\nlads at Bayonne,\\' the parson answered. \\'Bayonne!\\' cries my father, with\\n\\na jump. \\'Why, yes;\\' and the parson told him all about a great sally the\\n\\nFrench had made on the night of April 13th. \\'Do you happen to know if\\n\\nthe 38th Regiment was engaged?\\' my father asked. \\'Come, now,\\' said\\n\\nParson Kendall, \\'I didn\\'t know you was so well up in the campaign. But,\\n\\nas it happens, I _do_ know that the 38th was engaged, for \\'twas they\\n\\nthat held a cottage and stopped the French advance.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Still my father held his tongue; and when, a week later, he walked into\\n\\nHelston and bought a _Mercury_ off the Sherborne rider, and got the\\n\\nlandlord of the Angel to spell out the list of killed and wounded, sure\\n\\nenough, there among the killed was Drummer John Christian, of the 38th\\n\\nFoot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"After this there was nothing for a religious man but to make a clean\\n\\nbreast. So my father went up to Parson Kendall and told the whole story.\\n\\nThe parson listened, and put a question or two, and then asked:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Have you tried to open the lock since that night?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'I han\\'t dared to touch it,\\' says my father.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Then come along and try.\\' When the parson came to the cottage here, he\\n\\ntook the things off the hook and tried the lock. \\'Did he say\\n\\n_\"Bayonne\"?_ The word has seven letters.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Not if you spell it with one \"n\" as _he_ did,\\' says my father.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The parson spelt it out--B-A-Y-O-N-E. \\'Whew!\\' says he, for the lock had\\n\\nfallen open in his hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He stood considering it a moment, and then he said, \\'I tell you what. I\\n\\nshouldn\\'t blab this all round the parish, if I was you. You won\\'t get no\\n\\ncredit for truth-telling, and a miracle\\'s wasted on a set of fools. But\\n\\nif you like, I\\'ll shut down the lock again upon a holy word that no one\\n\\nbut me shall know, and neither drummer nor trumpeter, dead nor alive,\\n\\nshall frighten the secret out of me.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'I wish to gracious you would, parson,\\' said my father.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The parson chose the holy word there and then, and shut the lock back\\n\\nupon it, and hung the drum and trumpet back in their place. He is gone\\n\\nlong since, taking the word with him. And till the lock is broken by\\n\\nforce, nobody will ever separate those twain.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: HOW JAN BREWER WAS PISKEY-LADEN]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 19: From _The Wandering Heath,_ by Arthur Quiller-Couch.\\n\\nCopyright, 1895, by Charles Scribner\\'s Sons. By permission of the\\n\\npublishers.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW JAN BREWER WAS PISKEY-LADEN[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE moon was near her setting as a tall, broad-shouldered man called\\n\\nJan Brewer was walking home to Constantine Bay to his cottage on the\\n\\nedge of the cliff.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was singing an old song to himself as he went along, and he sang till\\n\\nhe drew near the ruins of Constantine Church, standing on a sandy common\\n\\nnear the bay. As he drew near the remains of this ancient church, which\\n\\nwere clearly seen in the moonshine, he thought he heard some one\\n\\nlaughing, but he was not quite sure, for the sea was roaring on the\\n\\nbeach below the common, and the waves were making a loud noise as they\\n\\ndashed up the great headland of Trevose.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I was mistaken; \\'twas nobody laughing,\" said Jan to himself, and he\\n\\nwalked on again, singing as before; and he sang till he came near a\\n\\ngate, which opened into a field leading to his cottage, but when he got\\n\\nthere he could not see the gate or the gateway.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I was so taken up with singing the old song, that I must have missed my\\n\\nway,\" he said again to himself. \"I\\'ll go back to the head of the common\\n\\nand start afresh,\" which he did; and when he got to the place where his\\n\\ngate ought to have been, he could not find it to save his life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I must be clean _mazed_,\"[21] he cried. \"I have never got out of my\\n\\nreckoning before, nor missed finding my way to our gate, even when the\\n\\nnight has been as dark as pitch. It isn\\'t at all dark to-night; I can\\n\\nsee Trevose Head--and yet I can\\'t see my own little gate! But I en\\'t\\n\\na-going to be done; I\\'ll go round and round this common till I _do_ find\\n\\nmy gate.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd round and round the common he went, but find his gate he could not.\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery time he passed the ruins of the church a laugh came up from the\\n\\npool below the ruins, and once he thought he saw a dancing light on the\\n\\nedge of the pool, where a lot of reeds and rushes were growing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The Little Man in the Lantern is about to-night,\"[22] he said to\\n\\nhimself, as he glanced at the pool. \"But I never knew he was given to\\n\\nlaughing before.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce more he went round the common, and when he had passed the ruins he\\n\\nheard giggling and laughing, this time quite close to him; and looking\\n\\ndown on the grass, he saw to his astonishment hundreds of Little Men and\\n\\nLittle Women with tiny lights in their hands, which they were\\n\\n_flinking_[23] about as they laughed and giggled.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Little Men wore stocking-caps, the color of ripe briar berries, and\\n\\ngrass-green coats, and the Little Women had on old grandmother cloaks of\\n\\nthe same vivid hue as the Wee Men\\'s coats, and they also wore little\\n\\nscarlet hoods.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I believe the great big chap sees us,\" said one of the Little Men,\\n\\ncatching sight of Jan\\'s astonished face. \"He must be Piskey-eyed, and we\\n\\ndid not know it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is he really?\" cried one of the _Dinky_[24] Women. \"\\'Tis a pity, but\\n\\nwe\\'ll have our game over him just the same.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That we will,\" cried all the Little Men and Little Women in one voice;\\n\\nand, forming a ring round the great tall fellow, they began to dance\\n\\nround him, laughing, giggling and flashing up their lights as they\\n\\ndanced.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey went round him so fast that poor Jan was quite bewildered, and\\n\\nwhichever way he looked there were these Little Men and Little Women\\n\\ngiggling up into his bearded face. And when he tried to break through\\n\\ntheir ring they went before him and behind him, making a game over him.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was at their mercy and they knew it; and when they saw the great\\n\\nfellow\\'s misery, they only laughed and giggled the more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got him!\" they cried to each other, and they said it with such\\n\\ngusto and with such a comical expression on their tiny brown faces, that\\n\\nJan, bewildered as he was, and tired with going round the common so many\\n\\ntimes, could not help laughing, they looked so very funny, particularly\\n\\nwhen the Little Women winked up at him from under their little scarlet\\n\\nhoods.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Piskeys--for they were Piskeys[25]--hurried him down the common,\\n\\ndancing round him all the time; and when he got there he felt so\\n\\nmizzy-mazey with those tiny whirling figures going round and round him\\n\\nlike a whirligig, that he did not know whether he was standing on his\\n\\nhead or his heels. He was also in a bath of perspiration--\"sweating\\n\\nleaking,\" he said--and, putting his hand in his pocket to take out a\\n\\nhandkerchief to mop his face, he remembered having been told that, if\\n\\nhe ever got Piskey-laden, he must turn his coat pockets inside out,\\n\\nthen he would be free at once from his Piskey tormentors. And\\n\\nin a minute or less his coat-pockets were hanging out, and all the\\n\\nLittle Men and the Little Women had vanished, and there, right in front\\n\\nof him, he saw his own gate! He lost no time in opening it, and in a\\n\\nvery short time was in his thatched cottage on the cliff.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: MY GRANDFATHER, HENDRY WATTY]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 20: From _Legends and Tales of North Cornwall_, by Enys\\n\\nTregarthen.

I don\\'t\\n\\nmind telling you about it. \\'Tis a curious tale, too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy grandfather, Hendry Watty, bet four gallons of eggy-hot that he would\\n\\nrow out to the Shivering Grounds, all in the dead waste of the night,\\n\\nand haul a trammel there. To find the Shivering Grounds by night, you\\n\\nget the Gull Rock in a line with Tregamenna and pull out till you open\\n\\nthe light on St. Anthony\\'s Point; but everybody gives the place a wide\\n\\nberth because Archelaus Rowett\\'s lugger foundered there one time, with\\n\\nsix hands on board; and they say that at night you can hear the drowned\\n\\nmen hailing their names. But my grandfather was the boldest man in Port\\n\\nLoe, and said he didn\\'t care. So one Christmas Eve by daylight he and\\n\\nhis mates went out and tilled the trammel; and then they came back and\\n\\nspent the forepart of the evening over the eggy-hot, down to Oliver\\'s\\n\\ntiddly-wink,[27] to keep my grandfather\\'s spirits up and also to show\\n\\nthat the bet was made in earnest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Twas past eleven o\\'clock when they left Oliver\\'s and walked down to the\\n\\ncove to see my grandfather off. He has told me since that he didn\\'t feel\\n\\nafraid at all, but very friendly in mind, especially toward William John\\n\\nDunn, who was walking on his right hand. This puzzled him at the first,\\n\\nfor as a rule he didn\\'t think much of William John Dunn. But now he\\n\\nshook hands with him several times, and just as he was stepping into the\\n\\nboat he says, \"You\\'ll take care of Mary Polly while I\\'m away.\" Mary\\n\\nPolly Polsue was my grandfather\\'s sweetheart at that time. But why my\\n\\ngrandfather should have spoken as if he was bound on a long voyage he\\n\\nnever could tell; he used to set it down to fate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I will,\" said William John Dunn; and then they gave a cheer and pushed\\n\\nmy grandfather off, and he lit his pipe and away he rowed all into the\\n\\ndead waste of the night. He rowed and rowed, all in the dead waste the\\n\\nnight; and he got the Gull Rock in a line with Tregamenna windows; and\\n\\nstill he was rowing, when to his great surprise he heard a voice\\n\\ncalling:\\n\\n\\n\\n    _\"Hendry Watty! Hendry Watty!\"_\\n\\n\\n\\nI told you my grandfather was the boldest man in Port Loe. But he\\n\\ndropped his two oars now, and made the five signs of Penitence. For who\\n\\ncould it be calling him out here in the dead waste and middle of the\\n\\nnight?\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"HENDRY WATTY! HENDRY WATTY! _drop\\n\\n    me a line_.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMy grandfather kept his fishing-lines in a little skivet under the\\n\\nstern-sheets. But not a trace of bait had he on board. If he had, he was\\n\\ntoo much a-tremble to bait a hook.\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"HENDRY WATTY! HENDRY WATTY! _drop\\n\\n    me a line, or I\\'ll know why_.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMy poor grandfather had by this picked up his oars again, and was rowing\\n\\nlike mad to get quit of the neighborhood, when something or somebody\\n\\ngave three knocks--_thump, thump, thump!_--on the bottom of the boat,\\n\\njust as you would knock on a door.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe third thump fetched Hendry Watty upright on his legs. He had no\\n\\nmore heart for disobeying, but having bitten his pipe-stem in half by\\n\\nthis time--his teeth chattered so--he baited his hook with the broken\\n\\nbit and flung it overboard, letting the line run out in the stern-notch.\\n\\nNot half-way had it run before he felt a long pull on it, like the\\n\\nsucking of a dog-fish.\\n\\n\\n\\n    _\"Hendry Watty! Hendry Watty! pull me in.\"_\\n\\n\\n\\nHendry Watty pulled in hand over fist, and in came the lead sinker over\\n\\nthe notch, and still the line was heavy; he pulled and he pulled, and\\n\\nnext, all out of the dead waste of the night, came two white hands, like\\n\\na washerwoman\\'s, and gripped hold of the stern-board; and on the left of\\n\\nthese two hands, was a silver ring, sunk very deep in the flesh. If this\\n\\nwas bad, worse was the face that followed--and if this was bad for\\n\\nanybody, it was worse for my grandfather who had known Archelaus Rowett\\n\\nbefore he was drowned out on the Shivering Grounds, six years before.\\n\\n\\n\\nArchelaus Rowett climbed in over the stern, pulled the hook with the bit\\n\\nof pipe-stem out of his cheek, sat down in the stern-sheets, shook a\\n\\nsmall crayfish out of his whiskers, and said very coolly: \"If you should\\n\\ncome across my wife--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThat was all that my grandfather stayed to hear. At the sound of\\n\\nArchelaus\\'s voice he fetched a yell, jumped clean over the side of the\\n\\nboat and swam for dear life. He swam and swam, till by the bit of the\\n\\nmoon he saw the Gull Rock close ahead. There were lashin\\'s of rats on\\n\\nthe Gull Rock, as he knew; but he was a good deal surprised at the way\\n\\nthey were behaving, for they sat in a row at the water\\'s edge and\\n\\nfished, with their tails let down into the sea for fishing-lines; and\\n\\ntheir eyes were like garnets burning as they looked at my grandfather\\n\\nover their shoulders.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hendry Watty! Hendry Watty! you can\\'t land here--you\\'re disturbing the\\n\\npollack.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bejimbers! I wouldn\\' do that for the world,\" says my grandfather; so\\n\\noff he pushes and swims for the mainland. This was a long job, and it\\n\\nwas as much as he could do to reach Kibberick beach, where he fell on\\n\\nhis face and hands among the stones, and there lay, taking breath.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe breath was hardly back in his body before he heard footsteps, and\\n\\nalong the beach came a woman, and passed close by to him. He lay very\\n\\nquiet, and as she came near he saw \\'twas Sarah Rowett, that used to be\\n\\nArchelaus\\'s wife, but had married another man since. She was knitting as\\n\\nshe went by, and did not seem to notice my grandfather; but he heard her\\n\\nsay to herself, \"The hour is come, and the man is come.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had scarcely begun to wonder over this when he spied a ball of\\n\\nworsted yarn beside him that Sarah had dropped. \\'Twas the ball she was\\n\\nknitting from, and a line of worsted stretched after her along the\\n\\nbeach. Hendry Watty picked up the ball and followed the thread on\\n\\ntiptoe. In less than a minute he came near enough to watch what she was\\n\\ndoing; and what she did was worth watching. First she gathered wreckwood\\n\\nand straw, and struck flint over touchwood and teened a fire. Then she\\n\\nunraveled her knitting; twisted her end of the yarn between finger and\\n\\nthumb--like a cobbler twisting a wax-end--and cast the end up towards\\n\\nthe sky. It made Hendry Watty stare when the thread, instead of falling\\n\\nback to the ground, remained hanging, just as if \\'twas fastened to\\n\\nsomething up above; but it made him stare still more when Sarah Rowett\\n\\nbegan to climb up it, and away up till nothing could be seen of her but\\n\\nher ankles dangling out of the dead waste and middle of the night.\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"HENDRY WATTY! HENDRY WATTY!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t Sarah calling, but a voice far away out to sea.\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"HENDRY WATTY! HENDRY WATTY! _send\\n\\n    me a line!\"_\\n\\n\\n\\nMy grandfather was wondering what to do, when Sarah speaks down very\\n\\nsharp to him, out of the dark:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hendry Watty! where\\'s the rocket apparatus? Can\\'t you hear the poor\\n\\nfellow asking for a line?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I do,\" says my grandfather, who was beginning to lose his temper; \"and\\n\\ndo you think, ma\\'am, that I carry a Boxer\\'s rocket in my trousers\\n\\npocket?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think you have a ball of worsted in your hand,\" says she. \"Throw it\\n\\nas far as you can.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo my grandfather threw the ball out into the dead waste and middle of\\n\\nthe night. He didn\\'t see where it pitched, or how far it went.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Right it is,\" says the woman aloft. \"\\'Tis easy seen you\\'re a hurler.\\n\\nBut what shall us do for a cradle?[28] Hendry Watty! Hendry Watty!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ma\\'am to _you,\"_ said my grandfather.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If you have the common feelings of a gentleman, I\\'ll ask you to turn\\n\\nyour back; I\\'m going to take off my stocking.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo my grandfather stared the other way very politely; and when he was\\n\\ntold he might look again, he saw she had tied the stocking to the line\\n\\nand was running it out like a cradle into the dead waste of the night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hendry Watty! Hendry Watty! look out below!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore he could answer, plump! a man\\'s leg came tumbling past his ear\\n\\nand scattered the ashes right and left.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hendry Watty! Hendry Watty! look out below!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThis time \\'twas a great white arm and hand, with a silver ring sunk\\n\\ntight in the flesh of the little finger.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hendry Watty! Hendry Watty! warm them limbs!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMy grandfather picked them up and was warming them before the fire, when\\n\\ndown came tumbling a great round head and bounced twice and lay in the\\n\\nfirelight, staring up at him. And whose head was it but Archelaus\\n\\nRowett\\'s, that he\\'d run away from once already that night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hendry Watty! Hendry Watty! look out below!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThis time \\'twas another leg, and my grandfather was just about to lay\\n\\nhands on it, when the woman called down:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hendry Watty! catch it quick! It\\'s my own leg I\\'ve thrown down by\\n\\nmistake.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe leg struck the ground and bounced high, and Hendry Watty made a leap\\n\\nafter it.\\n\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I reckon it\\'s asleep he must have been; for what he caught was not\\n\\nMrs. Rowett\\'s leg, but the jib-boom of a deep-laden brigantine that was\\n\\nrunning him down in the dark. And as he sprang for it, his boat was\\n\\ncrushed by the brigantine\\'s fore-foot and went down under his very\\n\\nboot-soles. At the same time he let out a yell, and two or three of the\\n\\ncrew ran forward and hoisted him up to the bowsprit and in on deck, safe\\n\\nand sound.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the brigantine happened to be outward bound for the River Plate; so\\n\\nthat, with one thing and another, \\'twas eleven good months before my\\n\\ngrandfather landed again at Port Loe. And who should be the first man he\\n\\nsees standing above the cove but William John Dunn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m very glad to see you,\" says William John Dunn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thank you kindly,\" answers my grandfather; \"and how\\'s Mary Polly?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, as for that,\" he says, \"she took so much looking after, that I\\n\\ncouldn\\'t feel I was properly keeping her under my eye till I married\\n\\nher, last June month.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You was always one to over-do things,\" said my grandfather.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But if you was alive an\\' well, why didn\\' you drop us a line?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNow when it came to talk about \"dropping a line,\" my grandfather fairly\\n\\nlost his temper. So he struck William John Dunn on the nose--a thing he\\n\\nhad never been known to do before--and William John Dunn hit him back,\\n\\nand the neighbors had to separate them. And next day, William John Dunn\\n\\ntook out a summons against him. Well, the case was tried before the\\n\\nmagistrates: and my grandfather told his story from the beginning, quite\\n\\nstraightforward, just as I\\'ve told it to you. And the magistrates\\n\\ndecided that, taking one thing and another, he\\'d had a great deal of\\n\\nprovocation, and fined him five shillings. And there the matter ended.\\n\\nBut now you know the reason why I\\'m William John Dunn\\'s grandson instead\\n\\nof Hendry Watty\\'s.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: CHILDE ROWLAND]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 26: From _The Wandering Heath_, by Arthur Quiller-Couch;\\n\\nCopyright, 1895, by Charles Scribner\\'s Sons.

She is now in the Dark Tower of the King of Elfland; it\\n\\nwould take the boldest knight in Christendom to bring her back.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If it is possible to bring her back,\" said her brother, \"I\\'ll do it, or\\n\\nperish in the attempt.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Possible it is,\" said the Warlock Merlin, \"but woe to the man or\\n\\nmother\\'s son that attempts it, if he is not well taught beforehand what\\n\\nhe is to do.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe eldest brother of Burd Ellen was not to be put off, by any fear of\\n\\ndanger, from attempting to get her back, so he begged the Warlock Merlin\\n\\nto tell him what he should do, and what he should not do, in going to\\n\\nseek his sister. And after he had been taught, and had repeated his\\n\\nlesson, he set out for Elfland.\\n\\n\\n\\n    But long they waited, and longer still,\\n\\n      With doubt and muckle pain,\\n\\n    But woe were the hearts of his brethren,\\n\\n      For he came not back again.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the second brother got tired and tired of waiting, and he went to\\n\\nthe Warlock Merlin and asked him the same as his brother. So he set out\\n\\nto find Burd Ellen.\\n\\n\\n\\n    But long they waited, and longer still,\\n\\n      With muckle doubt and pain,\\n\\n    And woe were his mother\\'s and brother\\'s heart,\\n\\n      For he came not back again.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd when they had waited and waited a good long time, Childe Rowland,\\n\\nthe youngest of Burd Ellen\\'s brothers, wished to go, and went to his\\n\\nmother, the good queen, to ask her to let him go. But she would not at\\n\\nfirst, for he was the last and dearest of her children, and if he was\\n\\nlost, all would be lost. But he begged, and he begged, till at last the\\n\\ngood queen let him go, and gave him his father\\'s good brand that never\\n\\nstruck in vain, and as she girt it round his waist, she said the spell\\n\\nthat would give it victory.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Childe Rowland said good-by to the good queen, his mother, and went\\n\\nto the cave of the Warlock Merlin. \"Once more, and but once more,\" he\\n\\nsaid to the Warlock, \"tell how man or mother\\'s son may rescue Burd Ellen\\n\\nand her brothers twain.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, my son,\" said the Warlock Merlin, \"there are but two things,\\n\\nsimple they may seem, but hard they are to do. One thing to do, and one\\n\\nthing not to do. And the thing to do is this: after you have entered the\\n\\nland of Fairy, whoever speaks to you, till you meet the Burd Ellen, you\\n\\nmust out with your father\\'s brand and off with their head. And what\\n\\nyou\\'ve not to do is this: bite no bit, and drink no drop, however hungry\\n\\nor thirsty you be; drink a drop or bite a bit, while in Elfland you be\\n\\nand never will you see Middle Earth again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Childe Rowland said the two things over and over again, till he knew\\n\\nthem by heart, and he thanked the Warlock Merlin and went on his way.\\n\\nAnd he went along, and along, and along, and still further along, till\\n\\nhe came to the horse-herd of the King of Elfland feeding his horses.\\n\\nThese he knew by their fiery eyes, and knew that he was at last in the\\n\\nland of Fairy. \"Canst thou tell me,\" said Childe Rowland to the\\n\\nhorse-herd, \"where the King of Elfland\\'s Dark Tower is?\" \"I cannot tell\\n\\nthee,\" said the horse-herd, \"but go on a little further and thou wilt\\n\\ncome to the cow-herd, and he, maybe, can tell thee.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, without a word more, Childe Rowland drew the good brand that never\\n\\nstruck in vain, and off went the horse-herd\\'s head, and Childe Rowland\\n\\nwent on further, till he came to the cow-herd, and asked him the same\\n\\nquestion. \"I can\\'t tell thee,\" said he, \"but go on a little further, and\\n\\nthou wilt come to the hen-wife, and she is sure to know.\" Then Childe\\n\\nRowland out with his good brand, that never struck in vain, and off went\\n\\nthe cow-herd\\'s head. And he went on a little further, till he came to an\\n\\nold woman in a gray cloak, and he asked her if she knew where the Dark\\n\\nTower of the King of Elfland was. \"Go on a little further,\" said the\\n\\nhen-wife, \"till you come to a round green hill, surrounded with\\n\\nterrace-rings, from the bottom to the top; go round it three times,\\n\\n\\'widershins,\\' and each time say:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"\\'Open, door! open, door!\\n\\n    And let me come in,\\'\\n\\n\\n\\nand the third time the door will open, and you may go in.\" And Childe\\n\\nRowland was just going on, when he remembered what he had to do; so he\\n\\nout with the good brand, that never struck in vain, and off went the\\n\\nhen-wife\\'s head.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he went on, and on, and on, till he came to the round green hill\\n\\nwith the terrace-rings from top to bottom, and he went round it three\\n\\ntimes, \"widershins,\" saying each time:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Open, door! open, door!\\n\\n    And let me come in.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the third time the door did open, and he went in, and it closed with\\n\\na click, and Childe Rowland was left in the dark.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was not exactly dark, but a kind of twilight or gloaming. There were\\n\\nneither windows nor candles, and he could not make out where the\\n\\ntwilight came from, if not through the walls and roof. There were rough\\n\\narches made of a transparent rock, incrusted with sheepsilver and rock\\n\\nspar, and other bright stones. But though it was rock, the air was quite\\n\\nwarm, as it always is in Elfland. So he went through this passage till\\n\\nat last he came to two wide and high folding-doors which stood ajar. And\\n\\nwhen he opened them, there he saw a most wonderful and glorious sight. A\\n\\nlarge and spacious hall, so large that it seemed to be as long, and as\\n\\nbroad, as the green hill itself. The roof was supported by fine pillars,\\n\\nso large and lofty, that the pillars of a cathedral were as nothing to\\n\\nthem. They were all of gold and silver, with fretted work, and between\\n\\nthem and around them wreaths of flowers, composed of what do you think?\\n\\nWhy, of diamonds and emeralds, and all manner of precious stones. And\\n\\nthe very key-stones of the arches had for ornaments clusters of diamonds\\n\\nand rubies, and pearls, and other precious stones. And all these arches\\n\\nmet in the middle of the roof, and just there, hung by a gold chain, an\\n\\nimmense lamp made out of one big pearl hollowed out and quite\\n\\ntransparent. And in the middle of this was a big, huge carbuncle, which\\n\\nkept spinning round and round, and this was what gave light by its rays\\n\\nto the whole hall, which seemed as if the setting sun was shining on it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe hall was furnished in a manner equally grand, and at one end of it\\n\\nwas a glorious couch of velvet, silk and gold, and there sat Burd Ellen,\\n\\ncombing her golden hair with a silver comb. And when she saw Childe\\n\\nRowland she stood up and said:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"God pity ye, poor luckless fool,\\n\\n      What have ye here to do?\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Hear ye this, my youngest brother,\\n\\n      Why didn\\'t ye bide at home?\\n\\n    Had you a hundred thousand lives\\n\\n      Ye couldn\\'t spare any a one.\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"But sit ye down; but woe, O, woe,\\n\\n      That ever ye were born,\\n\\n    For come the King of Elfland in,\\n\\n      Your fortune is forlorn.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen they sat down together, and Childe Rowland told her all that he had\\n\\ndone, and she told him how their two brothers had reached the Dark\\n\\nTower, but had been enchanted by the King of Elfland, and lay there\\n\\nentombed as if dead. And then after they had talked a little longer\\n\\nChilde Rowland began to feel hungry from his long travels, and told his\\n\\nsister Burd Ellen how hungry he was and asked for some food, forgetting\\n\\nall about the Warlock Merlin\\'s warning.\\n\\n\\n\\nBurd Ellen looked at Childe Rowland sadly, and shook her head, but she\\n\\nwas under a spell, and could not warn him. So she rose up, and went out,\\n\\nand soon brought back a golden basin full of bread and milk. Childe\\n\\nRowland was just going to raise it to his lips, when he looked at his\\n\\nsister and remembered why he had come all that way. So he dashed the\\n\\nbowl to the ground, and said: \"Not a sup will I swallow, nor a bit will\\n\\nI bite, till Burd Ellen is set free.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nJust at that moment they heard the noise of some one approaching, and a\\n\\nloud voice was heard saying:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Fee, fi, fo, fum,\\n\\n    I smell the blood of a Christian man,\\n\\n    Be he dead, be he living, with my brand,\\n\\n    I\\'ll dash his brains from his brain-pan.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then the folding-doors of the hall were burst open, and the King of\\n\\nElfland rushed in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Strike, then, Bogle, if thou darest,\" shouted out Childe Rowland, and\\n\\nrushed to meet him with his good brand that never yet did fail. They\\n\\nfought, and they fought, and they fought, till Childe Rowland beat the\\n\\nKing of Elfland down on to his knees, and caused him to yield and beg\\n\\nfor mercy. \"I grant thee mercy,\" said Childe Rowland; \"release my sister\\n\\nfrom thy spells and raise my brothers to life, and let us all go free,\\n\\nand thou shalt be spared.\" \"I agree,\" said the Elfin King, and rising up\\n\\nhe went to a chest from which he took a phial filled with a blood-red\\n\\nliquor. With this he anointed the ears, eyelids, nostrils, lips, and\\n\\nfinger-tips of the two brothers, and they sprang at once into life, and\\n\\ndeclared that their souls had been away, but had now returned. The Elfin\\n\\nKing then said some words to Burd Ellen, and she was disenchanted, and\\n\\nthey all four passed out of the hall, through the long passage, and\\n\\nturned their back on the Dark Tower, never to return again. So they\\n\\nreached home, and the good queen their mother and Burd Ellen never went\\n\\nround a church \"widershins\"[30] again.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: TAM O\\' SHANTER]\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 29: From _English Fairy Tales,_ by Joseph Jacobs.

The farmers had come\\n\\ninto town from all the country round about, to sell or exchange their\\n\\nfarm produce, and buy what they needed to take home.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmongst these farmers was a man by the name of Tam o\\' Shanter; a good\\n\\nnatured, happy-go-lucky sort of person, but, I am sorry to say, somewhat\\n\\nof a drunkard.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow Tam\\'s wife, whose name was Kate, was a grievous scold; always\\n\\nnagging and faultfinding, and I fear making it far easier for Tam to do\\n\\nwrong than if she had treated him more kindly. However that may be, Tam\\n\\nwas happier away from home; and this day had escaped his wife\\'s scolding\\n\\ntongue, mounted his good gray mare Meg, and galloped off as fast as he\\n\\ncould go to Market.\\n\\n\\n\\nTam, who was bent upon having a spree, found his good friend, the\\n\\nshoemaker Johnny, and off they went to their favorite ale house; where\\n\\nthey stayed telling stories and singing and drinking, till late at\\n\\nnight.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last the time came to go home and Tam who had forgotten the long\\n\\nmiles between him and the farm set forth, but a terrible storm had\\n\\nrisen; the wind blew, the rain fell in torrents and the thunder roared\\n\\nlong and loud.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a fearful night, black as pitch except for the blinding flashes\\n\\nof lightning; but Tam was well mounted on his good gray mare Maggie, and\\n\\nsplashed along through the wind and mire, holding on to his good blue\\n\\nbonnet, and singing aloud an old Scotch sonnet; while looking about him\\n\\nwith prudent care lest the bogies catch him unawares.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last he drew near to the old ruined church of Alloway. For many, many\\n\\nyears this old church had been roofless, but the walls were standing and\\n\\nit still retained the bell.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor many years it was said that the ghosts and witches nightly held\\n\\ntheir revels there, and sometimes rang the old bell. As Tam was crossing\\n\\nthe ford of the stream called the Doon, which flowed nearby, he looked\\n\\nup at the old church on the hillside above him, and behold! it was all\\n\\nablaze with lights, and sounds of mirth and dancing reached his ears.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow Tam had been made fearless by old John Barleycorn, and he made good\\n\\nMaggie take him close to the church so that he could look inside, and\\n\\nthere he saw the weirdest sight--\\n\\n\\n\\nWitches and ghosts in a mad dance, and the music was furnished by the\\n\\nDevil himself in the shape of a beast, who played upon the bagpipes, and\\n\\nmade them scream so loud that the very rafters rang with the sound.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was an awful sight; and as Tam looked in, amazed and curious, the fun\\n\\nand mirth grew fast and furious.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Piper loud and louder blew, and the dancers quick and quicker flew.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the witches resembled a handsome girl that Tam had known called\\n\\nNannie; Tam sat as one bewitched watching her as she danced, and at last\\n\\nlosing his wits altogether, called out: \"Weel done, Cutty-Sark!\"--and in\\n\\nan instant all was dark!\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had scarcely time to turn Maggie round, when all the legion of\\n\\nwitches and spirits were about him like a swarm of angry bees. As a\\n\\ncrowd runs, when the cry \"Catch the thief\" is heard, so runs Maggie; and\\n\\nthe witches follow with many an awful screech and halloo! Hurry, Meg!\\n\\nDo thy utmost! Win the keystone of the bridge, for a running stream they\\n\\n_dare_ not cross! _Then_ you can toss your tail at them! But before good\\n\\nMeg could reach the keystone of the bridge she had no tail to toss. For\\n\\nNannie far before the rest, hard upon noble Maggie prest,\\n\\nand flew at Tam with fury. But she little knew good Maggie\\'s\\n\\nmettle. With one spring, she brought off her master safe, but left\\n\\nbehind her own gray tail!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe witch had caught it and left poor Maggie with only a stump.\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 31: Prose Version, by Anna Cogswell Tyler.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTAM O\\' SHANTER[32]\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Of brownys and of bogilis full is this buke.\"--Gawin Douglas.\\n\\n\\n\\n    When chapman billies leave the street,\\n\\n    And drouthy neebors neebors meet,\\n\\n    As market-days are wearing late,\\n\\n    An\\' folk begin to tak\\' the gate;\\n\\n    While we sit bousing at the nappy,\\n\\n    An\\' gettin\\' fou and unco happy,\\n\\n    We think na on the lang Scots miles,\\n\\n    The mosses, waters, slaps, and stiles,\\n\\n    That lie between us and our hame,\\n\\n    Where sits our sulky sullen dame,\\n\\n    Gathering her brows like gathering storm,\\n\\n    Nursing her wrath to keep it warm.\\n\\n\\n\\n    This truth fand honest Tam o\\' Shanter,\\n\\n    As he frae Ayr ae night did canter,\\n\\n    (Auld Ayr, wham ne\\'er a town surpasses,\\n\\n    For honest men and bonny lasses.)\\n\\n    O Tam!

He caused a good\\n\\ndeal of trouble, and he kept tormenting the children, day and night, in\\n\\nvarious ways. Sometimes their bread and butter would be snatched away,\\n\\nor their porringers of bread and milk be capsized by an invisible hand;\\n\\nfor the Boggart never let himself be seen; at other times the curtains\\n\\nof their beds would be shaken backwards and forwards, or a heavy weight\\n\\nwould press on and nearly suffocate them. Their mother had often, on\\n\\nhearing their cries, to fly to their aid.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a kind of closet, formed by a wooden partition on the\\n\\nkitchen-stairs, and a large knot having been driven out of one of the\\n\\ndeal-boards of which it was made, there remained a round hole. Into\\n\\nthis, one day, the farmer\\'s youngest boy stuck the shoe-horn with which\\n\\nhe was amusing himself, when immediately it was thrown out again, and\\n\\nstruck the boy on the head. Of course it was the Boggart did this, and\\n\\nit soon became their sport, which they called _larking with the\\n\\nBoggart,_ to put the shoe-horn into the hole and have it shot back at\\n\\nthem. But the gamesome Boggart at length proved such a torment that the\\n\\nfarmer and his wife resolved to quit the house and let him have it all\\n\\nto himself. This settled, the flitting day came, and the farmer and his\\n\\nfamily were following the last loads of furniture, when a neighbor named\\n\\nJohn Marshall came up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Georgey,\" said he, \"and so you\\'re leaving t\\'ould hoose at last?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Heigh, Johnny, my lad, I\\'m forced to it; for that bad Boggart torments\\n\\nus so, we can neither rest night nor day for\\'t. It seems to have such a\\n\\nmalice against t\\'poor bairns, it almost kills my poor dame here at\\n\\nthoughts on\\'t, and so, ye see, we\\'re forced to flitt loike.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe scarce had uttered the words when a voice from a deep upright churn\\n\\ncried out. _\"Aye, aye, Georgey, we\\'re flittin ye see!\"_\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ods, alive!\" cried the farmer, \"if I\\'d known thou would flit too, I\\'d\\n\\nnot have stirred a peg!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd with that, he turned about to his wife, and told her they might as\\n\\nwell stay in the old house, as be bothered by the Boggart in a new one.\\n\\nSo stay they did.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 33: From _Fairy-Gold_, a book of old English Fairy Tales.\\n\\nChosen by Ernest Rhys.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Twenty-Four Unusual Stories for Boys\\n\\nand Girls, by Anna Cogswell Tyler\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
